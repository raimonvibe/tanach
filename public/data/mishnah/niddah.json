Rather, they assume their ritual impurity status begins at that moment, in terms of rendering impure <i>teruma</i> and ritually pure items with which they come in contact. <b>Hillel says: From examination [<i>mipekida</i>] to examination,</b> i.e., she assumes ritual impurity status retroactive to the last time she examined herself and determined that she was ritually pure, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if her examination took place <b>several days</b> earlier.

For <b>any woman who has a fixed</b> menstrual <b>cycle [<i>veset</i>],</b> and she examined herself at that time and discovered blood, <b>her time is sufficient,</b> and it is only from that time that she transmits ritual impurity. <b>And</b> with regard to a woman <b>who engages in intercourse while</b> using <b>examination cloths [<i>be’edim</i>]</b> before and after intercourse, with which she ascertains whether her menstrual flow began, the halakhic status of such an action <b>is like that of an examination, and</b> therefore <b>it reduces</b> the time <b>from</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> reduces the time <b>from examination to examination.</b>"

But with regard to all non-sacred items, even non-sacred items treated with the sanctity of sacrificial food, such as the water used to rinse the Paschal offering, she has second-degree ritual impurity. Consequently, it is permitted for her to touch not only the vessel, but the water inside it as well, <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say:</b> The status of the woman is <b>even like</b> that of one who is <b>impure</b> due to contact with <b>a corpse,</b> who is a primary source of ritual impurity and renders even a non-sacred vessel impure."

            "english": "There is a dispute with regard to a woman <b>who sees</b> blood on the <b>eleventh day,</b> which is the final day of the period fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. It is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband after observing one clean day corresponding to the one day that she saw blood, but in this case, she failed to observe one clean day. Rather, <b>she immersed</b> in a ritual bath that <b>evening,</b> the eve of the twelfth day, <b>and</b> then <b>engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband. <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Since she did not observe that corresponding clean day, she retains the status of a <i>zava</i>. Therefore both she, the <i>zava</i>, and her husband, who engaged in intercourse with a <i>zava</i>, <b>transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting,</b> to the extent that these transmit impurity to food and drink that came in contact with them, and in her case, to people as well. <b>And</b> each of them is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin offering for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Although they transmit impurity to items designated for lying or sitting, <b>they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering.</b> Since the twelfth day is unfit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>, and even if she were to experience bleeding on the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth days she would not become a greater <i>zava</i>, one who experiences bleeding on the eleventh does not need to observe a corresponding clean day. If the woman <b>immersed on the day following</b> the eleventh day <b>and she engaged in intercourse with</b> the man of <b>her house,</b> i.e., her husband, on that twelfth day <b>and then saw</b> blood, <b>Beit Shammai say: They transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting</b> by rabbinic law, as the Sages issued a decree of impurity in the case when the second day is the twelfth day, due to a case when the second day is within the eleven days fit for the flow of a <i>zava</i>. <b>And they are exempt from</b> bringing <b>the</b> sin <b>offering,</b> as she observed part of the twelfth day, and the bleeding she experienced after engaging in intercourse, which occurred during her period of menstruation, is not fit to be appended to the discharge of the <i>zava</i> on the eleventh day. <b>And Beit Hillel say: That</b> husband <b>is a glutton,</b> as he could not wait for the conclusion of the twelfth day before engaging in intercourse. Nevertheless, the Sages did not issue a decree of impurity. <b>And</b> Beit Hillel <b>concede</b> to Beit Shammai <b>in</b> a case where the woman <b>sees</b> blood <b>in the midst of the eleven-day</b> period, <b>and she immersed in the evening and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband without observing a corresponding clean day, <b>that they transmit impurity</b> to items designated for <b>lying or sitting. And</b> each of them is <b>liable to</b> bring a sin <b>offering</b> for participating in intercourse involving a <i>zava</i>. If she saw blood in the midst of the eleven days and observed part of a corresponding clean day and <b>immersed on the day following</b> the day that she saw blood <b>and engaged in intercourse</b> with her husband, <b>that is wayward conduct,</b> as the possibility exists that she will experience bleeding after intercourse that will be appended to the bleeding of the previous day, rendering her a <i>zava</i> and disqualifying the immersion. <b>And</b> the status of ritually impure items with which <b>they came into contact and</b> the status of <b>their intercourse is contingent</b> upon whether she experiences bleeding on the day of her immersion, in which case the ritually pure items become impure and they are liable to bring a sin offering, or whether she does not experience bleeding that day, in which case the ritually pure items remain pure and the woman and man are exempt from bringing a sin offering."
