The mishna elaborates: <b>How</b> do these eight cases take place? In order to answer that question, the mishna cites cases involving a poor person and a homeowner. <b>The poor</b> person <b>stands outside,</b> in the public domain, <b>and the homeowner stands inside,</b> in the private domain. <b>The poor person</b> lifted an object in the public domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the private domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the homeowner.</b> In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the poor person reached his hand into the private domain, <b>took</b> an item from the hand of the homeowner, <b>and carried</b> it <b>out</b> into the public domain. In that case, the poor person performed the prohibited labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. In both of these cases, because <b>the poor person</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the homeowner is exempt.</b> The mishna cites two additional cases. In these, the prohibited labor is performed by the homeowner, who is in the private domain: <b>The homeowner</b> lifted an item in the private domain, <b>extended his hand into</b> the public domain, <b>and placed</b> the object <b>into the hand of the poor person.</b> In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying out from the private domain into the public domain in its entirety. <b>Or,</b> the homeowner reached his hand into the public domain, <b>took</b> an object <b>from</b> the hand of the poor person, <b>and carried</b> it <b>into</b> the private domain. In that case, the homeowner performed the labor of carrying from the public domain into the private domain in its entirety. In both of those cases, because <b>the homeowner</b> performed the prohibited labor in its entirety, he <b>is liable and the poor person is exempt.</b> There are four additional cases where neither the homeowner nor the poor person performed the labor in its entirety, and therefore neither is liable: <b>The poor person extended his hand into</b> the private domain <b>and</b> either <b>the homeowner took</b> an object <b>from</b> his hand and placed it in the private domain <b>or</b> the homeowner <b>placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the hand of the poor person, and the poor person <b>carried</b> the object <b>out</b> into the public domain. In those cases and the two that follow, the act of transferring the object from one domain to another was performed jointly by two people, the poor person and the homeowner. Because each performed only part of the prohibited labor, <b>both of them are exempt.</b> So too, in a case where <b>the homeowner extended his hand into the public domain and,</b> either <b>the poor person took</b> an object <b>from</b> the homeowner’s hand and placed it in the public domain <b>or the poor person placed</b> an object <b>into</b> the homeowner’s hand and the homeowner <b>carried</b> the object <b>into</b> the private domain.

            "english": "The mishna continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the third day</b> after relations <b>is ritually impure,</b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days,</b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the third day,</b> meaning the third day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the third day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The mishna cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. "
