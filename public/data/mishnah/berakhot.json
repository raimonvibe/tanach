            "english": "The beginning of tractate <i>Berakhot</i>, the first tractate in the first of the six orders of Mishna, opens with a discussion of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, as the recitation of <i>Shema</i> encompasses an acceptance of the yoke of Heaven and of the mitzvot, and as such, forms the basis for all subsequent teachings. The Mishna opens with the laws regarding the appropriate time to recite <i>Shema</i>: <br><br><b>From when,</b> that is, from what time, does <b>one recite <i>Shema</i> in the evening? From the time when the priests enter to partake of their <i>teruma.</i></b> Until when does the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> extend? <b>Until the end of the first watch.</b> The term used in the Torah (Deuteronomy 6:7) to indicate the time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <i>beshokhbekha</i>, when you lie down, which refers to the time in which individuals go to sleep. Therefore, the time for the recitation of <i>Shema</i> is the first portion of the night, when individuals typically prepare for sleep. <b>That is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> <b>The Rabbis say:</b> The time for the recitation of the evening <i>Shema</i> is <b>until midnight.</b> <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> One may recite <i>Shema</i> <b>until dawn,</b> indicating that <i>beshokhbekha</i> is to be understood as a reference to the entire time people sleep in their beds, the whole night. The mishna relates that Rabban Gamliel practiced in accordance with his ruling. There was an <b>incident</b> where Rabban Gamliel’s <b>sons returned</b> very late <b>from a wedding hall. They said to him,</b> as they had been preoccupied with celebrating with the groom and bride: <b>We did not recite <i>Shema.</i> He said to them: If the dawn has not</b> yet <b>arrived, you are obligated to recite</b> <i>Shema</i>. Since Rabban Gamliel’s opinion disagreed with that of the Rabbis, he explained to his sons that the Rabbis actually agree with him, <b>and</b> that it is <b>not only</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the recitation of <i>Shema</i>, <b>but rather, wherever the Sages say until midnight, the mitzva</b> may be performed <b>until dawn.</b> Rabban Gamliel cites several cases in support of his claim, such as <b>the burning of fats and limbs</b> on the altar. Due to the quantity of offerings each day, the priests were often unable to complete the burning of all of the fats and limbs, so they continued to be burned into the night, as it is written: “This is the law of the burnt offering: The burnt offering shall remain upon the pyre on the altar all night until morning, while the fire on the altar burns it” (Leviticus 6:2). <b>And,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings <b>that are eaten for one day</b> and night; although the Sages state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten <b>until dawn.</b> This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). <b>If so, why did the Sages say</b> that they may be eaten only <b>until midnight?</b> This is <b>in order to distance a person from transgression,</b> as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed."

The mishna explains this verse as follows: “<b>With all your heart”</b> means <b>with your two inclinations, with your good inclination and your evil inclination,</b> both of which must be subjugated to the love of God. <b>“With all your soul”</b> means <b>even if God takes your soul. “And with all your might”</b> means <b>with all your money,</b> as money is referred to in the Bible as might. <b>Alternatively,</b> it may be explained that “<b>with all your might”</b> means <b>with every measure that He metes out to you;</b> whether it is good or troublesome, <b>thank Him.</b> The mishna teaches several Temple-related <i>halakhot</i>. <b>One may not act irreverently</b> or conduct himself flippantly <b>opposite the eastern gate</b> of the Temple Mount, <b>which is aligned opposite the Holy of Holies.</b> In deference to the Temple, one <b>may not enter the Temple Mount with his staff, his shoes, his money belt [<i>punda</i>], or</b> even <b>the dust on his feet. One may not make</b> the Temple <b>a shortcut</b> to pass through it, <b>and through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference,</b> all the more so <b>one may not spit</b> on the Temple Mount. The mishna relates: <b>At the conclusion of all blessings</b> recited <b>in the Temple, those</b> reciting the blessing <b>would say:</b> Blessed are You Lord, God of Israel, <b>until everlasting [<i>haolam</i>]</b>, the world. But <b>when the Sadducees strayed and declared</b> that <b>there is but one world</b> and there is no World-to-Come, the Sages <b>instituted that</b> at the conclusion of the blessing <b>one recites: From everlasting [<i>haolam</i>] to everlasting [<i>haolam</i>]</b>. The Sages also <b>instituted that one should greet another in the name</b> of God, i.e., one should mention God’s name in his greeting, <b>as it is stated: “And presently Boaz came from Bethlehem and said to the harvesters, The Lord is with you, and they said to him, May the Lord bless you”</b> (Ruth 2:4). <b>And it says:</b> “And the angel of God appeared to him <b>and said to him, God is with you, mighty man of valor”</b> (Judges 6:12). <b>And it says: “And despise not your mother when she is old”</b> (Proverbs 23:22), i.e., one must not neglect customs which he inherits. <b>And</b> lest you say that mentioning God’s name is prohibited, <b>it says: “It is time to work for the Lord; they have made void Your Torah”</b> (Psalms 119:126), i.e., it is occasionally necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to perform God’s will, and greeting another is certainly God’s will. <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> another interpretation of the verse: <b>“Make void Your Torah” because “it is the time to work for the Lord,”</b> i.e., occasionally it is necessary to negate biblical precepts in order to bolster the Torah."
