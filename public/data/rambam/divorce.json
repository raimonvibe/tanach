            "english": "A woman may be divorced only by receiving a bill [of divorce].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Guide for the Perplexed (Vol. III, Chapter 49), the Rambam explains a rationale for this mitzvah. If it were possible to effect a divorce through speech alone, a woman might commit adultery and then try to free herself of liability by claiming that she had been divorced previously. Requiring a written bill of divorce prevents such a possibility from arising.</i> This bill is called a <i>get</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>get</i> is Aramaic for legal document, and indeed when accompanied by a modifier is used to refer to other types of legal documents. Nevertheless, the most common use of the word is within the context of divorce, and when the term <i>get</i> appears without a modifier, it generally refers to a bill of divorce. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Gittin</i> 2:5.)</i><br>The Torah establishes ten principles as fundamental [for a divorce to be effective].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 222) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (Mitzvah 579) consider this to be one of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>The intent is not that it is a mitzvah to divorce one's wife, but rather that if a man does desire to divorce his wife, it is a mitzvah for him to follow the rules prescribed by the Torah. To cite a parallel example: There is not a mitzvah to eat meat. If, however, one does desire to eat meat, it is a mitzvah to have the animal slaughtered according to the rules prescribed by the Torah.</i> They are:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The details of all these principles are described in the halachot and chapters that follow.</i><br>a) That a man must voluntarily initiate the divorce;<br>b) That he must effect the divorce by means of a written document and through no other means;<br>c) That this document must communicate that he is divorcing [his wife] and releasing her from his domain;<br>d) That it should utterly sever the connection between the husband and his wife;<br>e) That [the <i>get</i>] should be written for the sake [of the woman being divorced];<br>f) That once [the <i>get</i>] is written, there should be no action [necessary] except its transfer to the woman;<br>g) That he should actually transfer [the <i>get</i>] to her;<br>h) That he should transfer [the <i>get</i>] to her in the presence of witnesses;<br>i) That he should actually transfer it to her for the sake of divorce;<br>j) That the husband or his agent should be the one who gives it to her.<br>The other requirements of a <i>get</i> - e.g., dating it, having it signed by witnesses and the like - are all Rabbinic institutions."

The <i>get</i> is acceptable. This applies at all times and in all places.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The application of this law is not confined to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> or to the era when the <i>Sanhedrin</i> (the High Court of Law) was in power.</i><br>Similarly, if gentiles beat him while telling him: \"Do what the Jews are telling you to do,\" and the Jews have the gentiles apply pressure on him until [he consents] to divorce his wife, the divorce is acceptable. If, however, the gentiles compel him to write [a <i>get</i>] on their own initiative, the <i>get</i> is [merely] unacceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Mesharshia states that the Rabbis deemed the <i>get</i> unacceptable, lest women become accustomed to hiring gentiles for this purpose (<i>Bava Batra</i> 48a). In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo notes that <i>Gittin</i> 88b appears to reject Rav Mesharshia's view and states that a <i>get</i> that was forced on a man by gentiles is void entirely. (This indeed is the ruling of Rashi, Rabbenu Nissim and Rabbenu Asher.) In his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 134:5), Rav Yosef Karo's wording is not specific when dealing with this issue. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 134:10 states that such a <i>get</i> is void.</i> The rationale is that the law requires him to give a divorce.<br>Why is this <i>get</i> not void? For he is being compelled - either by Jews or by gentiles - [to divorce] against his will [and a <i>get</i> must be given voluntarily].<br>Because the concept of being compelled against one's will applies only when speaking about a person who is being compelled and forced to do something that the Torah does not obligate him to do - e.g., a person who was beaten until he consented to a sale,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Mechirah</i> 10:1, which states that such a sale is acceptable, after the fact. Nevertheless, if the seller notifies the witnesses that he was compelled to sell against his will, the sale is nullified.</i> or to give a present. If, however, a person's evil inclination presses him to negate [the observance of] a mitzvah or to commit a transgression, and he was beaten until he performed the action he was obligated to perform, or he dissociated himself from the forbidden action, he is not considered to have been forced against his will. On the contrary, it is he himself who is forcing [his own conduct to become debased].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements have implications far beyond their immediate halachic context. The Rambam is saying that the fundamental desire of every Jew is to affirm his Jewishness and observe the Torah and its mitzvot. Even when a person's conscious mind does not necessarily consent to this inner motivation, it is at work, molding his character without his knowledge. And at times, either because of undesirable circumstances - being compelled against his will as above - or because of desirable ones - an expression of Divine favor - this inner drive will surface.</i><br>With regard to this person who [outwardly] refuses to divorce [his wife] - he wants to be part of the Jewish people, and he wants to perform all the mitzvot and eschew all the transgressions; it is only his evil inclination that presses him. Therefore, when he is beaten until his [evil] inclination has been weakened, and he consents [to the divorce], he is considered to have performed the divorce willfully.<br>[Different laws apply when] the law does not require him to divorce his wife, and a Jewish court or simple people compel him to divorce her. This <i>get</i> is deemed unacceptable. Since, however, it was Jews who compelled him, he [is advised] to complete the divorce [in a proper manner]. If, by contrast, gentiles compel him to divorce when it was not required, the divorce is void. Even though he tells the gentiles that he consented and tells the Jews to write and sign [a <i>get</i>], since the law does not require him to divorce, and he was compelled to do so by gentiles, the <i>get</i> is void."

Generally, the rule that is followed is that with regard to questions involving Scriptural law, the concept of <i>b'reirah</i> is not accepted, but with regard to Rabbinic law it is accepted. On this basis, the commentaries question the Rambam's ruling. In the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rav Yosef Karo explains that although with regard to following stringencies, we say that the concept of <i>b'reirah</i> does not apply to questions of Scriptural law, it does apply with regard to the acceptance of a leniency. Therefore, although the woman must consider herself divorced, she does not have the prerogative of remarrying. On this basis, Rav Yosef Karo quotes the Rambam's wording in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 130:4).

If she is standing next to her courtyard, the divorce is effective.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to a courtyard, a point of clarification is necessary. In general, the benefit from a woman's property belongs to her husband, and whatever is acquired by her property belongs to him.

Rav Meir HaLevi, as quoted by the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 139) differs and maintains that the woman must be present at the time the <i>get</i> is placed in her courtyard. If she is not present at that time, Rav Meir HaLevi maintains that the divorce is not effective unless the husband waits and tells the woman: \"This is your <i>get</i>,\" when she picks it up, or the husband must pick it up and give it to her again.<br>The Rashba submits a third opinion. He maintains that the status of the divorce is doubtful, for perhaps the woman desired the divorce. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 139:2-3 and commentaries.)</i><br>[These principles apply] even when the <i>get</i> will be guarded in the courtyard in which [it is placed]. [The rationale is that] divorce is considered to be a liability [and not an advantage] for [a woman]. And a liability may not be invoked against [a person] outside his [or her] presence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When considering something which is to a person's advantage - e.g., the acquisition of an ownerless object - a person may perform this act on behalf of a colleague without his knowledge, for our Sages postulated: \"one may act to a person's advantage outside his presence.\" The rationale is that the person would probably desire to acquire the object. When, however, a liability is considered, this principle does not apply. Nevertheless, if a woman explicitly states that a <i>get</i> should be placed in her courtyard, the divorce is effective even when she is not standing next to it (<i>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer</i> 139).</i>"

Based on the objections of the Ra'avad, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> modifies the Rambam's ruling slightly, explaining that the intent is that the woman may not remarry, and not that the <i>get</i> is void. If, however, she does remarry, her second husband is also required to divorce her.<br>The <i>get</i> she received from her first husband is not void, because it is possible that witnesses will come and verify the signatures on the <i>get</i>. In such an event, the divorce will be effective retroactively. Nevertheless, since those signatures have not been verified as of yet, her second husband must divorce her.<br>Rav David Arameah explains that the Rambam's intent is that the <i>get</i> is still viable, but it should be given to another agent to effect the divorce. Note the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> and others, who question the source for the Rambam's ruling.</i>"

The Hebrew term <i>toch k'dei dibbur</i> has a very specific meaning: the amount of time necessary to say \"<i>Shalom alecha, rabbi umori</i>.\"</i> [after appointing the agent];<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The rationale is that divorcing a wife is a very serious matter, and a man would not make such a decision unless he were resolute. Therefore, his change of mind is not considered to be a clarification of his original position (as in certain other instances - e.g., a retraction of a business commitment), but rather an entirely new decision. (Note the parallels to <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 7:22, <i>Hilchot Avodah Zarah</i> 2:9 and <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 2:17.)</i> since [the <i>get</i>] was nullified after being delivered to the woman, to [her] <i>sh'liach kabbalah</i> or to her courtyard, it is not void, and the divorce is effective."

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 134:3) rules according to the Rashba. The Ramah maintains that Rabbenu Asher's ruling is halachically acceptable; however, he counsels following the Rashba's ruling to eliminate all doubts.</i> [The husband] must answer \"Yes.\"<br>Afterwards, he should instruct them to write the <i>get</i>, sign it and give it to his wife.

But if this stipulation is not made, but instead the husband [merely] gave her the <i>get</i> and it is in her possession, she is not required to make any statements [to the court]. We assume that she is divorced, for she is in possession of a <i>get</i> that is written according to law and that is signed by witnesses.<br>Although we do not recognize the signatures of the witnesses, and [their authenticity] has not been verified, we do not suspect that [the woman] forged them, for she would not cause her own ruin.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is likely that a forgery would ultimately be discovered, and she would then be forbidden to remain married to her second husband, nor would she be permitted to return to her first husband.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> draws a connection between this halachah and Chapter 12, Halachah 2, which states that the statements of a woman who produces a <i>get</i> are accepted, even though the authenticity of the signatures of the witnesses to the <i>get</i> has not been verified. The Ra'avad in his gloss on <i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 6:7 differs (see also his gloss to Chapter 12, Halachah 2). The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 142:13-14) quotes the opinions of both the Rambam and the Ra'avad. See the Rivash (Responsum 385).</i><br>Moreover, it is considered as if the witnesses who signed the <i>get</i> had testified in court, until a protest is raised. Therefore, we assume that the <i>get</i> was written according to law and [grant the woman permission to] marry, as we assume that a <i>get</i> brought by an agent [in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>] is acceptable until the husband raises a protest or until he brings proof that it is a forgery or that it is void.<br>For if we had suspicions concerning these matters and the like, we would have to suspect that perhaps when a husband gave a <i>get</i> in our presence, he nullified it before he gave it; perhaps the witnesses who sign it are unacceptable, causing it to be regarded as a forgery; or perhaps it was not written for the sake [of the man or the woman being divorced]. Just as we do not entertain suspicions concerning these factors and assume that the <i>get</i> [is acceptable] until it is discovered that it is void, so too, we do not entertain suspicions concerning an agent or a woman when a <i>get</i> is in their possession. [The rationale is] that the laws governing prohibitions differ from those governing financial transactions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With regard to financial transactions, a person's statements are not accepted if he has an interest in the matter, unless he substantiates them with proof. Therefore, if a person gives a servant a deed of release that states that he has been freed and has been granted his master's possessions, his word is accepted with regard to his freedom. With regard to the possessions, however, he is required to substantiate his statements by verifying the authenticity of the witnesses to the deed (<i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 7:2).</i>"

She cannot be consecrated, and marital relations with her are considered adulterous.

Nevertheless, in this instance, since the condition was made for the sake of the woman, if she is willing to forego seeing her husband, the husband may nullify the <i>get</i> (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> For this reason, the <i>get</i> is unacceptable [even] after 30 days [pass without the husband seeing her].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., according to Scriptural law, since the condition was fulfilled, and there is no evidence that the couple resolved their differences, the <i>get</i> is binding.

For although a <i>get</i> is acceptable when it has not been signed, this is not desirable. Hence, we are more suspicious of the possibility of forgery.</i> If there are two witnesses who observed the husband giving the <i>get</i> to the agent and instructing him to use it for the divorce, the divorce is binding.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">66</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As long as there are witnesses who observe the transfer of the <i>get</i>, the agent's actions are considered to be equivalent to those of the husband himself. Hence, just as a <i>get</i> given by the husband is acceptable after the fact if its transfer was observed by witnesses, even if the <i>get</i> was not signed, this same ruling applies when his agent gives the <i>get</i>.</i>"

(See also the responsum of the Rambam quoted by the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> in his gloss on Chapter 8, Halachah 4.)</i> we have used the terms \"the <i>get</i> is void,\" or \"the divorce is not effective,\" the intent is that the <i>get</i> is void according to Scriptural law. The woman is married in the full sense of the term.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 150:3), however, accepts the Rambam's ruling.</i> with one exception: a person who divorces his wife and tells her: \"You are divorced from me, but you are not permitted to marry anyone else.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 8, Halachah 5.</i> Although such a divorce is not binding, according to Rabbinic law<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam considers the proof-text that he quotes as an <i>asmachta</i> - i.e., a support from the Torah invented by the Rabbis to uphold their decree. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> himself differs, noting that <i>Gittin</i> 82a appears to indicate that the prohibition is of Scriptural origin.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> explains that the Rambam's conception can be resolved based on his statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (General Principle 2), that any law that is not explicitly stated in the Torah, but rather derived through the Thirteen Principles of Biblical exegesis, is considered to be Rabbinic in origin (<i>midivrei soferim</i>). This classification does not, however, in any way diminish the status of this practice, and it is as though it were explicitly stated in the Torah. (See the commentaries on <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 1:2.) Similarly, in this instance the prohibition is not explicit in the Torah, but rather derived through exegesis. Thus, it has the status of Scriptural law, but is considered to be Rabbinic in origin.<br>It must be emphasized that just as the woman is prohibited from remarrying a priest if divorced, she is also prohibited from remaining married to her husband, if he is a priest [<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 150:3)].</i> such a woman is forbidden to marry a priest, as [implied by Leviticus 21:7]: \"[They may not take] a woman divorced from her husband.\" Our Sages interpreted this to mean: \"Even if she is divorced only from her husband and not permitted to marry any one else, she is forbidden to the priesthood. This is the \"wisp of a <i>get</i>\" that disqualifies [a woman] from [marrying a member of] the priesthood by Rabbinic decree."

The School of Hillel differs and maintains that if a woman wrongs her husband, even with regard to as insignificant a matter as burning his meal, he may divorce her. Rabbi Akiva goes even further and maintains that even if a person finds a more attractive woman, he may divorce his wife.<br>Most authorities agree that in this, as in most other instances, the halachah follows the School of Hillel. Why then does the Rambam (and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> [<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:3]) follow the opinion of the School of Shammai?<br>Among the resolutions offered is that the difference of opinion between the Schools of Shammai and Hillel applies only with regard to a second marriage. With regard to a first marriage, by contrast, even the School of Hillel accepts the School of Shammai's stringency (<i>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer</i> 119).<br>Note also the statements of the Ramah, who rules that the prohibition applied only during the Talmudic era, when a woman could be divorced against her will.

First he says that it is forbidden to divorce one's first wife, and then he states that one should not hurry, implying that one may, but that it is ethical not to be impulsive about the matter. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:2 offers two resolutions: a) The prohibition exists only when, as was possible in the Talmudic era, the husband is divorcing his first wife against her will. If she is willing to accept the divorce, there is no prohibition; one should, however, proceed without haste. b) Even when one hears about improper sexual conduct, one should not be hasty about the matter.

Since a deaf-mute is considered to be mentally incapable, such a person is unable to establish a marriage bond that is binding according to Scriptural law. Our Rabbis made certain provisions for the marriage of such individuals, as explained in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 4:9. In this instance, however, since the woman was not a deaf-mute at the time of marriage, the marriage is binding according to Scriptural law.<br>The law teaches us that since according to Scriptural and Talmudic law, a woman can be divorced against her will, the fact that the woman is mentally incapable does not prevent her husband from divorcing her. Since a woman who is a deaf-mute is not totally incapable of caring for herself, our Sages did not make provisions for her, as they did for a woman who becomes mentally unsound.</i> he may divorce her, [by giving her] a <i>get</i>, and the divorce is effective. If, however, [his wife] loses control of her mental or emotional faculties,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">76</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also refers to a situation in which the woman lost control of her faculties after marriage. If, however, she was mentally unstable at the outset, any marriage that she enters into is not binding at all (<i>Hilchot Ishut, loc. cit.</i>).</i> he may not divorce her until she regains stability.<br>This is a prescript ordained by our Sages so that she will not [be divorced and left] unattended, [and be violated] by immoral people, for she is unable to care for herself. Therefore, [her husband] should provide a place for her, provide her with food and drink from her own resources,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">77</sup><i class=\"footnote\">He must, however, put at the woman's disposal the money due her by virtue of her marriage contract and the money due from her dowry (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:9).</i> and marry another woman. He is not obligated to provide her with her sustenance, garments and conjugal rights.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">78</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This ruling does not apply in the Ashkenazic community, nor in other places where the custom is to follow the ban of Rabbenu Gershom not to divorce one's wife against her will. In these communities, the husband is required to provide for his wife's sustenance and garments from his own resources. The rationale is that since he is not able to divorce her - for she is not capable of consenting to the divorce - he remains liable to bear the financial burden of supporting her (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:9).<br>The husband is not, however, obligated to give her conjugal rights. The <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119) and the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:12 state that in such a situation, the husband may be granted license to marry a second wife by 100 rabbis.</i> [For although our Sages compelled the husband to remain married to such a woman, they did not compel him to live with her as man and wife,] because a mentally sound individual cannot endure living with a mentally incapable person in one dwelling.<br>[The husband] is not obligated to provide her with medical treatment,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">79</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Even according to the law in Talmudic times, many differ with the Rambam's thesis and maintain that the husband is obligated for his wife's medical expenses.<br>The Ra'avad protests that in many instances, a person with mental disorders can be rehabilitated, and he maintains that the husband should be required to pay for such treatment. The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 119:11 states that even the Rambam would agree to such an obligation.<br>In the Ashkenazic community today, just as a husband is required to supply his wife with her sustenance in such a situation, he is also held liable for all her medical expenses (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:6, <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 119:12).</i> nor to redeem her if she is taken captive. If he divorces her, the divorce is binding.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Ra'avad mentions, in an instance when a woman has lost mental competence to the extent that she cannot safeguard the <i>get</i> she was given, all authorities agree that the divorce is not binding. Even when she has that degree of mental competence, there are many authorities that maintain that the divorce is not effective. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 119:6) quotes the Rambam's view, as interpreted by the Ra'avad. The Ramah follows the more stringent views.</i> He should remove her from his home, and he is not obligated to care for her."

Rav Chananiah states that the reason is that we suspect that the woman is lying. Rav Simi bar Ashi states that we suspect that in an instance where her husband appears to be dying, the woman will not be careful and will conclude that he died, even though he remained alive.<br>The Rambam's citation of the first opinion in this halachah represents a reversal of his thinking. For in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Yevamot</i> 15:1), he mentions the latter view.<br>According to the Rambam's opinion stated here, even if the woman says that she buried her husband, her word is not accepted (<i>Hagahot Maimoniot;</i> Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:48).</i> If one witness comes and testifies on her behalf that her husband died, she should not [be granted permission to] marry; we fear that perhaps she hired him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> notes that this issue is left unresolved by <i>Yevamot</i> 116b, and therefore, the Rambam chooses the more stringent view. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> questions why the Rambam ignores the rationale given by the Talmud - that in most cases, a woman who is granted permission on the basis of the testimony of one witness is careful and thoroughly investigates the matter before she marries, but in this instance, because of her hatred of her husband, she will not make such an investigation - and offers another rationale that is not mentioned there.<br>Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi (in a responsum quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) offers a resolution to this matter, explaining that the Rambam accepts the testimony of a single witness in such instances without question, because we assume that a person will not lie in an instance where the truth will shortly be revealed. (See the notes at the conclusion of this chapter.) Nevertheless, since the question is left unresolved by our Sages, and a very severe matter is involved, the Rambam does not desire to offer a leniency that was not accepted by our Sages. Therefore, he offers a different rationale, even though it was not mentioned in the Talmud.<br>On the basis of this explanation, Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi explains that if a witness comes to the court on his own initiative, the woman is granted license to remarry even when differences existed between her and her husband previously. The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:95, however, states that this leniency is not accepted by the latter authorities.</i> If, however, she marries, nevertheless, she need not leave [her second husband], for there is a witness who supports her."

Alternatively, because he buried him, he will have seen his features closely and will not mistakenly identify him.<br>As stated in Halachah 3, the testimony of a woman who says that her husband died at war is not accepted, even if she says that she buried him. The commentaries, however, differentiate between the two instances, explaining that since the woman's husband is involved, she will be more emotionally upset and less objective. Hence, it is more likely that she would mistake the deceased's identity.<br>Alternatively, she desires to remarry, and thus she will stretch the truth slightly to be granted that license, while an outsider will not take such liberties.<br>With regard to the concept of burial in relation to a person who drowned, there are three opinions mentioned by the Rabbis:<br>a) The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that if the witness sees that the person did not emerge after waiting the length of time in which one would ordinarily drown, he did not have to bury the deceased in order to testify. (<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> notes that this interpretation makes the following halachah appear slightly redundant.)<br>b) The <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:62 states that the intent was that we saw the corpse after it was taken out from the water.<br>c) The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (Volume I, <i>Even HaEzer</i>, Responsum 28) states that the intent is that the drowned man was actually buried.

Therefore, she should not be granted permission to remarry. Since the question is left unresolved, the ruling given by the Rambam applies.<br>In the responsum quoted by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi explains that - as reflected by the concluding halachah of this chapter - the Rambam maintains that the testimony of one witness is accepted, because the matter will surely be revealed in the near future. Nevertheless, he still maintains that, at the outset, the woman should not be granted permission to remarry, because in these situations it is possible for a person to think that a man has died, even though he is actually alive.</i>"

For it is unlikely that a witness will testify falsely.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">80</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See similar statements in <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i> 3:14 and <i>Hilchot Yibbum VaChalitzah</i> 4:31.<br>The Ra'avad and others note that our Sages (<i>Yevamot</i> 93b, 115a) mention two rationales why a woman should be permitted to remarry, the one cited by the Rambam and also because of the severe consequences that she will bring upon herself if her husband is found alive (see Chapter 10, Halachah 7), a woman will investigate the matter thoroughly and will not remarry unless she is certain that he has actually died. The Talmud appears to imply that these rationales are contradictory and cites cases in which one would apply, but not the other.<br>The <i>Noda BiY'hudah</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) explains that the Rambam sees the two rationales as complementary. Ordinarily, when a matter can easily be verified - e.g., a question of whether or not <i>chalitzah</i> was performed - the statement of one witness is acceptable without question. In this instance, however, it is not always easy to verify whether in fact the man died, and therefore the rationale that the woman must investigate the matter is necessary. For this reason, in all the instances where the Talmud implies that one rationale would conflict with another, the Rambam reaches a conclusion that takes both rationales into consideration.</i><br>For this reason, our Sages [extended] the leniency with regard to this matter and accepted the testimony of a single witness that is based on the testimony of a maidservant, [testimony] from a written document, and [testimony] that was not investigated by the ordinary process of interrogation. [These leniencies were accepted] so that the daughters of Israel will not be forced to remain unmarried.<br>Blessed be the Merciful One, who grants assistance."
