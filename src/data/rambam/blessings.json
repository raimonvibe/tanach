Thus, it has all the authority of a Torah law. Though the Rambam (see the Introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, General Principle 2) refers to laws derived in this manner as מדברי סופרים - literally, \"from the words of our Sages,\" the same term used here - his intent is not to imply that the law did not originate in the Torah itself.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot,</i> loc. cit.), however, explain that the Talmud ultimately does not accept the interpretation that the obligation is derived from the Torah, and maintain that the obligation to recite blessings is Rabbinic in origin. Even according to these opinions, it appears that the Sages ordained the recitation of blessings rather early in our national history. Midrashim referring to the age of King David explicitly mention the recitation of blessings, and there are intimations of this obligation in references to earlier periods. See also the commentary on Halachah 5.</i> that we recite blessings before partaking of any food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, states: \"It is forbidden to benefit from this world without reciting a blessing.\" Therefore,</i> Even when one wants to eat the slightest amount of food or drink,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., less than a <i>k'zayit</i> or a <i>revi'it</i></i> one should recite a blessing, and then derive benefit from it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, however, a blessing need not be recited after eating or drinking.</i><br>Similarly, when smelling a pleasant fragrance, one should recite a blessing<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 9 with regard to the particular blessings required.</i> and then smell.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 43b quotes Psalms 150:6: \"All souls shall praise God,\" and asks: \"From what does a soul benefit? Fragrance.\"</i> Anyone who derives benefit [from this world] without reciting a blessing is considered as if he misappropriated a sacred article.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 35a explains that the entire world belongs to God, as Psalms 24:1 declares: \"The earth and its fullness are God's.\" Although God allows man to benefit from this world, that license is granted only when man acknowledges God's control by reciting a blessing.</i><br>The Rabbis also ordained that one should recite a blessing after eating or drinking, provided one drinks a <i>revi'it</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The word <i>revi'it</i> means \"a fourth.\" It is one fourth of a larger measure, known as a <i>log</i>. In contemporary measure, a <i>revi'it</i> is equivalent to 86.6 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 150 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.</i> and eats a <i>k'zayit</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Anything less is not considered significant enough to require a blessing afterwards. A blessing beforehand must nevertheless be recited, because \"it is forbidden to benefit from this world without a blessing.\"<br>There is, however, a law which appears to be an exception to this principle:</i> A person who [merely] tastes food is not required to recite a blessing before partaking of it or afterwards unless he partakes of a <i>revi'it</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav David Arameah explains that this law applies only when one spits out the food one tastes. If one swallows it, a blessing is required. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs, and maintains that even when a person swallows the food, since his intent is not to benefit from it - but merely to taste it - and he partakes of only a very small amount, a blessing is not required.</i>"

When the listener is not obligated - e.g., a woman for shofar blowing - a person should not recite a blessing unless he is obligated himself (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 589:6).</i><br>There is, however, one exception: blessings over benefit which is not associated with a mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e.g., the blessings recited over food in an ordinary meal.</i> In this instance, one may not recite a blessing for others unless one enjoys benefit together with them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, there is no obligation for a person to partake of this food. Hence, the principle of ערבות does not apply (Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>) unless the person reciting the blessing also desires to partake of the food. Should he desire to do so, the blessing he recites may include others as well. (Note an alternate explanation in the commentary on Chapter 5, Halachah 16.)</i> Nevertheless, one may recite blessings for benefit which is associated with a mitzvah<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting kiddush [on Sabbaths and festivals] - i.e., not only the blessing <i>al achilat matzah</i>, which mentions the mitzvah of eating <i>matzah</i>, but also the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>, which is recited for eating bread; not only the blessing of <i>kiddush</i>, but also the blessing <i>borey pri hagafen</i>, on the wine.</i> - e.g., eating matzah on Pesach and reciting <i>kiddush</i> [on Sabbaths and festivals] - for others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">since, in this instance, the only way the mitzvah can be fulfilled is by eating the food.<br>Note the <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 273, which states that, at the outset, a person who has already recited <i>kiddush</i> should not recite <i>kiddush</i> for others, unless they are incapable of doing so themselves.</i> They may then eat or drink, even though the one [who recites the blessing] does not eat or drink with them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, which states that a person is not allowed to recite<i>hamotzi</i> to enable a colleague to partake of the Sabbath meal when he does not join them. There is reason to assume that, since partaking of such a meal is a mitzvah, one would be allowed to recite a blessing, and thus enable a colleague to do so. Nevertheless, following the reasoning mentioned in <i>Sefer HaKovetz</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 167:20) and commentaries mention only the examples cited by the Rambam.</i>"

This, however, is a unique instance and does not apply to blessings recited in the prayer service or over the fulfillment of other mitzvot. With regard to grace, the child's recitation of the blessings comes as a result of a single Rabbinic obligation. Hence, he can fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of an individual whose obligation is also Rabbinic in origin.<br>In contrast, with regard to other blessings, the blessings themselves are Rabbinic in origin, and the child's obligation to recite them constitutes a second Rabbinic obligation.

These three, however, are unique in that they refer to the establishment of a covenant regarding the bond between the Jews and the Torah.1. <i>Berachot</i> 49a mentions both these possibilities. In \"The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,\" the Rambam quotes the former expression.2. The beginning of a blessing must share the same theme as its conclusion. Nevertheless, the rebuilding of Jerusalem shares a connection with God's showing mercy to the people of Israel, since the rebuilding of Jerusalem is an expression of God's mercy to the Jewish people (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).3. Although <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that two different concepts should not be mentioned in the conclusion of a blessing, this version of the blessing does not contradict that rule. The intent is a single request that Israel be granted the ultimate comfort, the rebuilding of Jerusalem.4. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> 48b, mentions another reason for the mention of the House of David. It was David who conquered Jerusalem and established the holiness of the city. 5. Since an integral element of our celebration of the Sabbath and festivals is eating festive meals, the sacred element of the day should be mentioned in the grace recited after partaking of those meals. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of the day does not require a blessing in its own right, nor is it made the essential element of the third blessing. Therefore, one begins and concludes that blessing in the same manner as is done during the week (Rashi, <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 48b).6. The order in which these alternatives are mentioned in this halachah is the reverse of that mentioned in the previous halachah. It can be explained that in the previous halachah, the Rambam mentioned the text he considered most appropriate first. The order he mentions in this halachah, however, is closer to the expression used by our Sages in <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the source for this halachah.7. Pesach, Shavuot, and Sukkot. With regard to Rosh HaShanah, see the commentary on Halachah 13.8. <i>Shabbat</i> 24a explains that since an additional sacrifice (<i>korban musaf</i>) is offered on these days, they possess an element of sanctity that is worthy of mention. As obvious from the contrast of Halachah 12 to Halachah 13, however, there is a difference between the obligation to mention these days and the obligation to mention Sabbaths and festivals. 9. Since Chanukah and Purim are Rabbinic holidays which are not associated with an additional sacrificial offering, they are not mentioned in the third blessing. The second blessing is more appropriate for the mention of the miracles of these holidays, since it is an expression of thanks to God (<i>Shabbat</i> 24a).<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> note that from <i>Shabbat</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), it would appear that while permission is granted to mention Chanukah and Purim in the second blessing, it is not an obligation to do so. In contrast, the Rambam requires that they be mentioned. They explain that since the Sages of the Talmud were wont to mention these holidays in grace, and the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 7:6) considers their mention a binding obligation, the Rambam established their mention as a requirement. See also Halachah 13 and commentary.10. Precedence is given to the Sabbath because it occurs more frequently than the festivals and is on a higher spiritual level (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). 11. \"Blessed are You, God, our Lord, 16King13 of the Universe, the God, who is our Father and our 16King13... the 16King13 who is good.\" The reason for this stress on God's sovereignty in this blessing is that the blessing recited previously mentions the sovereignty of the House of David, and the Sages wanted to emphasize how all earthly kings are subordinate to a higher authority (<i>Berachot</i> 49a).12. The blessing mentioned is quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46a. That source also contains additions to the blessing that Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi would recite. 13. The Rambam's words are quoted from <i>Berachot</i> 46b, which relates that Mar Zutra recited this blessing.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 379:14) relates that this blessing should be recited throughout the seven days of mourning by the mourners and by all who recite grace together with him when there is a <i>zimun</i>. Other opinions (based on <i>Ketubot</i> 8a) state that this blessing should be recited only when ten people recite grace together. The <i>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</i> 207:7 writes that it is Ashkenazic custom to rely on this opinion, and hence, this blessing is generally not recited.14. <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) relates several additions Mar Zutra made on the above occasion.15. In \"The Order of Prayers for the Entire Year,\" the Rambam includes several requests beginning with the word <i>Harachaman</i> (May the Merciful One...) in his text of grace. These requests were additions to the grace made by the Geonim, who lived in the era subsequent to the Talmud. 16. This refers to the final blessing quoted in Halachah 11.17. <i>Nisu'in</i> (marriage) is marked by the entry of a bride and groom into a private chamber together. This ceremony is referred to as <i>chuppah</i> and is accompanied by a celebration. See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 10, and commentaries.<br>As mentioned at the conclusion of the following halachah, according to the Rambam this blessing is recited only when ten adult males are present. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:4) differs and maintains that it should be recited even when fewer than ten people are present. Note the Ramah (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 62:7) who states that today this blessing is never recited alone. If \"new faces\" - people who had not attended the wedding celebrations previously - are present, all seven blessings are recited. If no \"new faces\" are present (although ten males are), the meal is considered like a meal eaten by the bridegroom alone, and the blessing is not recited.18. The same laws applying to a widow or widower apply to a person who has been divorced. Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:12, the Rambam states that even if a woman has been married before, her husband should celebrate with her for three days.19. Surely, this also applies when neither the bride nor groom have been married before. <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states: \"The Sages ordained that everyone who marries a maiden should celebrate with her for seven days.\"<br>The differences between the time limits mentioned in this halachah and those mentioned in Chapter 5, Halachah 5, are worthy of comparison. See the commentary on that halachah.20. <i>Ketubot</i> 8a states that after the first day of the wedding celebrations, Rav Ashi would recite the wedding blessings only when \"new faces\" were present. In his responsa, the Rambam's son states that his father required only two \"new faces.\" Note the <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 64:7 who requires only one \"new face.\" The <i>Hagahot Maimoniot</i> write that on the Sabbath the presence of new guests is not necessary, since the Sabbath itself is considered as \"guests.\"21. <i>Ketubot</i> 7b derives this rule from the account of the wedding between Ruth and Boaz. Ruth 4:2 relates that Boaz invited ten men to witness the marriage. 22. Only six blessings are mentioned below; the seventh blessing is the blessing over the wine. (See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 10:4.)23. Rashi (<i>Ketubot</i> 7b) explains that this blessing is in praise of the creation of Adam, the first man.<br>In <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, where the text of the wedding blessings is repeated, this blessing follows the blessing \"who has created all things for His glory.\" This order is the sequence in which these blessings are recited today. It appears more appropriate, particularly according to Rashi's commentary (<i>loc. cit.</i>), which explains that the blessing \"who has created all things...\" is not directly connected to the wedding itself, but rather is recited in appreciation of the guests who have come to celebrate together with the new couple.<br>[The repetition of the text of the blessings in two separate halachot, something very out of character for the Rambam in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, has aroused the attention of the commentaries. Some have gone so far as to suggest that the text of the blessings here was added by the printers, and not by the Rambam himself.]24. Despite the fact that this blessing follows two (or three) blessings which begin with \"Blessed...,\" it also begins with \"Blessed....\" Among the explanations offered is that the first blessings are short, and if the line \"Blessed...\" were not mentioned, they would appear as a single blessing (<i>Tosafot, Ketubot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>).25. Rashi (<i>loc. cit.</i>) interprets this as a reference to the creation of woman, who was created from man (\"his own self\"), and gives him the potential for reproduction (\"a structure that will last for all time\").26. \"The barren one\" refers to Jerusalem. Psalms 137:6 states: \"Let my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not place Jerusalem above my highest joy.\" Thus, at the height of the wedding celebration, we recall the holy city and pray that it be rebuilt. 27. This is a prayer that the bride and groom enjoy the happiness experienced by Adam in Eve before the first sin.<br>Several manuscripts and early printings of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> mention a different conclusion for this blessing, \"Blessed are You, God, who brings joy to His people, Israel, and rebuilds Jerusalem.\" (In this context, note the commentary of the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)28. The blessing joins our wishes for the happiness of the particular couple with our hope for the Messianic redemption and the rebuilding of Jerusalem. The ultimate marriage relationship is the bond between God and the Jewish people, which will be realized in the Messianic age. Thus, the two themes, marriage and redemption, share an intrinsic link.29. Rashi, <i>Ketubot</i> 8a, explains the difference between the last two blessings. The fifth of the blessings concludes with a request that the bride and groom enjoy a lifetime of happiness and success together. The sixth and final blessing concludes with a request that they find happiness in each other, that their wedding joy be extended throughout their lives. Alternatively, the final blessing is a blessing for the Jewish people as a whole who find fulfillment in married life.</i>"

As will be explained, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 188:8) does make such a distinction with regard to the repetition of grace. Nevertheless, if a person remembers his omission in time to add the special blessing, even the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:7) requires it to be recited after any and all meals on Sabbaths and festivals.</i> Blessed [are You, God...] who has granted rest to His people Israel as a sign and a holy covenant.

This view is not shared by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and several other commentaries, who point to the fact that neither <i>Berachot</i> 49a nor the Rambam explicitly mentions God's sovereignty. Nevertheless, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) shares the <i>Lechem Mishneh's</i> position.</i> who has granted festivals to His people Israel for rejoicing and for happiness. Blessed are You, God, who sanctifies Israel and the seasons.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The sanctification of the festivals is dependent on the Jews, who fix the monthly calendar.

We are obligated to eat only two meals that require grace on these holy days. One may fulfill his obligation for the third meal with other foods, without eating bread on the Sabbath, whereas on festivals one is not obligated to eat a third meal at all.<br>Accordingly, although there is a dimension of holiness connected with all the Sabbath and festival meals, the need to mention this dimension in grace is considered significant enough to require repetition of all the blessings only when an omission is made in the first two meals of the day.<br>It must be noted that neither the Rambam nor <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) make such a differentiation explicitly. This has led the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> and others to postulate that the Rambam maintains that an omission of the Sabbath or festivals in grace is sufficient to require repetition of the blessings in any meal eaten on these holy days.</i> and return to the beginning [of grace], the blessing for sustenance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If three people ate together and made the same omission, however, they do not repeat the <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>:9).<br>The Ra'avad challenges the Rambam's decision, calling attention to a law quoted by the Rambam in <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 10:10. When a person omits <i>Ya'aleh v'yavo</i> in the <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>, he is required to repeat the entire <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Nevertheless, if he is accustomed to recite prayers of supplication after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> before withdrawing from his place of prayer, and remembers while in the midst of those supplications, he is not required to repeat <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. All that is necessary is to return to the blessing <i>R'tzey</i>.<br>Similarly, the Ra'avad argues, the blessing <i>Hatov v'hametiv</i> resembles the supplicatory prayers recited after <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i>. Accordingly, one should return to the third blessing of grace and not recite the other two.<br>This opinion, although respected for its sound reasoning, is not accepted by most authorities. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:6) and others quote the Rambam's view.</i>"

See Halachah 4.<br>Literally, the Rambam's words mean \"grain cooked as it is.\" The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this to mean \"as it comes from the silo.\"</i> a person should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the blessing recited for eating vegetables and other products of the earth (Chapter 8, Halachah 1).<br><i>Berachot</i> 37a states, \"A person who chews [kernels of] wheat should recite the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i>.\" Even though the grain has been cooked, since the kernels were not processed at all, it does not warrant a blessing of greater importance (<i>Kessef Mishnah</i>).<br>The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:3-6 discusses the question of grains that are cooked whole, but are cooked for a long period until their shell dissolves. There are authorities who recommend that unless the kernels have been cooked to the extent that they stick together as a single mass, whole grains should be eaten only in the midst of a meal containing bread. See also Halachah 4.</i> Afterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The blessing usually recited after partaking of foods other than those from the seven species for which <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> was praised. The same rationale mentioned above applies. Since the kernels were served without being processed, they do not warrant a blessing of greater importance.</i> Before eating flour,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which has not been cooked</i> a person should recite the blessing <i>shehakol</i>. Afterwards, he should recite the blessing <i>borey nefashot rabbot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance as well, the special blessings for grain products are not recited because the food was not prepared in the usual fashion. Furthermore, even the blessing <i>borey pri ha'adamah</i> is not recited, because generally people do not eat flour (Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, See also <i>Berachot</i> 36a).1. I.e., it resembles a porridge.2. Because of the importance of the five species of grain, the Sages ordained the recitation of a special blessing before and after partaking of them. Since this mixture is considered a food and not a beverage, it warrants the recitation of these blessings.3. Since this mixture is considered a beverage and not a food, it does not warrant the recitation of these blessings. 4. <i>Berachot</i> 37b relates that any food that is made from the five species of grain but is not considered bread requires the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i>. Since these foods are cooked in a pot, they are not considered bread. See also note 6.5. Since the grain kernels have been processed slightly, they are considered worthy of the special blessings ordained for foods from the five species. As mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 2, the later authorities suggest that the grains be cooked to the point that they stick together as a single mass before these blessings should be recited. If, however, both the shell of the kernel has been removed and they have been crushed, the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> may be recited even when the kernels do not stick together (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 208:15).6. As mentioned in Halachah 6, as long as the grain is included to add flavor, it is considered the primary element in the mixture, and the blessing <i>al hamichyah</i> should be recited, even though quantitatively, the dish contains a majority of other substances. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 208:2.) 7. The definition of foods as primary and secondary depends on the person's intention and not the quantity of the foods included in the mixture.8. This principle is quoted from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7.9. Thus producing a single food, as exemplified in Halachah 6.10. In this instance, the two foods remain separate, yet the secondary food is included in the blessing recited over the primary one, as exemplified in Halachah 7. 11. The Rambam is quoting <i>Berachot</i> 39a, which states that this law applies even to turnips that require a large amount of flour.12. <i>Beitzah</i> 38a states, \"Anything added for flavor is never considered negligible.\"<br>The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 204:25 and the <i>Chacham Tzvi</i> (Responsum 129) explain that the Rambam's (and the Talmud's) statements apply only to products from the five species of grain. Whenever they are added to flavor foods, they are considered of primary importance even when, quantitatively, they are less than the other ingredients of a particular dish. In contrast, when two or more types of foods other than grain products are mixed together in a single dish and both are intended to add flavor and/or satiate the person eating, the food which is greater in quantity is considered as the primary ingredient.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> adds that if the starch was added for flavor, the mixture would require the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>. He continues, explaining that when other foods - e.g., fruits which are not usually eaten raw, are cooked in sugar to produce jam, the fruits are considered of primary importance. Hence, the blessing <i>borey pri ha'etz</i> should be recited. See <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 204:11. 14. By adding the clause, \"so that the heavy brine...,\" the Rambam explains the source for this ruling, <i>Berachot</i> 6:7, and clarifies a problem posed by the commentaries.<br>Although the Mishnah mentions the example of bread serving as a secondary food when it accompanies salted foods, the Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 44a) protests, and explains that in almost all situations bread would be considered the primary food. The Mishnah is describing a specific instance: people who eat fruit that originates in the area around Lake Kineret.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, the Rambam explains that this refers to people who work as watchmen in orchards. They eat large quantities of fruit. Hence, in order to help their digestion, they also must partake of brine. Since the brine itself could be harmful, they eat bread with it.<br>Here, also, the Rambam is referring to a case where the person has no desire to eat bread and does so only to protect his throat. If, however, a person wanted to eat salted fish on bread and desired both the bread and the fish, he must recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> and recite grace. (See <i>Turei Zahav</i> 212:1-2.)<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 212:2 gives another example: A person who eats bread to weaken the taste of an alcoholic beverage. 16. A <i>k'zayit</i>. In contemporary measure, it is equivalent to 28.8 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i> and 33 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.17. Out of faithfulness to the Rambam's text, we have translated his words literally, although they have caused the commentaries great difficulty. On the surface, there is an open contradiction between the first clause and the second clause. From the first clause, it appears that a piece of bread less than the size of an olive which resembles bread warrants the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. In contrast, the latter clause appears to indicate that the bread must both be the size of an olive and have the appearance of bread to warrant the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>Because of this difficulty, the Radbaz (Vol. V, Responsum 1393) and <i>Sefer HaBatim</i> have suggested amending the text and rendering the latter clause, \"If they are not the size of an olive and no longer resemble bread because of the cooking process.\" Furthermore, even without amending the text, this interpretation can be accepted, since, as the Rambam's own descendant, Rabbi Yehoshua, explains, there are times when the Hebrew או can be rendered as \"if.\" Thus, the passage would read, \"If they are not the size of an olive, if....\"<br>Rav Yosef Karo was aware of the text's difficulty and the suggestions to amend it. Nevertheless, both in his <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:10), he seeks to justify the Rambam's choice of phraseology, explaining his statements as follows:<br>When one cooked pieces of bread or mixed them into soup, if they are the size of an olive, one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> although they no longer resemble bread. If they are less than the size of an olive but resemble bread, one should recite this blessing when they have been mixed into soup. If, however, they have been cooked, and although it is obvious that these pieces came from a loaf of bread, they no longer have the appearance of bread, only the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited.<br>To summarize: when one breaks bread into pieces and puts them into soup, since the pieces still resemble bread they may not be eaten unless one recites the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. If the pieces of bread were cooked completely to prepare a different food and less than a <i>k'zayit</i> remains whole, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should be recited. According to most authorities, if one cooks with bread crumbs or matzah meal, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>, should be recited on the foods produced.</i>"

When the wood had burned until all that remained was glowing coals, they would remove them and fill the hole with dough. Afterwards, the coals would be placed above the dough and allowed to remain there until the dough was baked. (See also <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 6:6.)</i> one should recite the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and not <i>hamotzi</i></i> because it does not have the appearance of bread.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The fact that it does not look like bread - although its manner of preparation, taste, and texture are similar - is significant enough to prevent it from receiving the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<br>[The Rambam's conception is significant since other halachic authorities - e.g., the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:40 - maintain that<i>hamotzi</i> should not be recited because this dough is soft, like pancakes.]</i> If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Based on <i>Berachot</i> 42a, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:6) interprets this to mean \"a measure that others would usually use as the basis for a meal even though, personally, one is not satisfied from it.\"<br>Quantitatively, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the intention is a full meal, an <i>isaron</i>. [He arrives at this calculation as follows: In the desert, the Jews received an <i>omer</i> of manna for two meals each day. An <i>omer</i> is twice the quantity of an <i>isaron</i>.] This is approximately 22 <i>k'beitzot</i>, or 1266 cc according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 1452 cc according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>. This figure includes not only the grain product, but also other foods - e.g., meat, fish, or vegetables - that are eaten together with it.<br>Nevertheless, there are more stringent opinions, and accordingly, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 168:24 suggest not eating a meal consisting of more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food with such \"bread\" as its base.</i> one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 168:8 states that the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> was designated for bread to indicate its importance as a satisfying food and the foundation of our diet. Hence, it was instituted only for breads that are usually served for such a purpose. If, however, a person decided to serve another food made from flour and resembling bread with a similar intent, it is also appropriate that he recite <i>hamotzi</i>.</i><br>Similar [laws apply to] dough that was kneaded with honey, oil, or milk,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7) states that all that is necessary is to mix enough of these ingredients into the dough so that their taste is felt. The Ramah and the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:16 differ and maintain that the amount of these ingredients must exceed the quantity of water used. Support for their ruling can be drawn from the Rambam's statements in <i>Hilchot Chametz UMatzah</i> 5:20.<br>The above is significant with regard to what is popularly called today <i>mezonot</i> bread, which is produced by using apple juice instead of (or together with) water. According to the Ramah, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> should not be recited:a) if the dough is made with more water than juice, b) if one uses this bread as the basis for a large meal.</i> or mixed together with different condiments<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">sugar, honey, nuts, fruits, or spices</i> and baked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">producing a product which, like cake, is generally eaten for pleasure and not as the basis of a meal.</i> It is referred to as <i>pat haba'ah b'kisnin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the<i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 168:7), which offers two other interpretations of the term, <i>pat haba'ah b'kisnin</i>:a) Rabbenu Chananel's interpretation - dough filled with other sweet substances - e.g., pies that are served for dessert, like apple pie;b) Rav Hai Gaon's interpretation - crackers.</i> Although it [resembles] bread, the blessing <i>borey minei mezonot</i> is recited over it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">because it is not food which, like bread, is the foundation of our diets.</i> If, however, one uses it as the basis of a meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">eating the quantity mentioned above of this grain product either alone or together with other foods (<i>Magen Avraham</i> 168:13)</i> one should recite the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) states that all three opinions may be accepted as halachah, and none of these three types of foods requires the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> or grace, unless it is eaten as the basis of a meal.<br>There are, however, several difficulties with the application of this decision in contemporary situations, particularly with regard to \"<i>mezonot</i> bread.\" Surely, when one eats a complete meal, serving such bread does not free one of the obligation of washing and reciting grace. Furthermore, there are difficulties even when one eats only a snack with such bread. First, some authorities - e.g., Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi in his <i>Piskei Siddur</i> - state that a meticulous person should not each such bread without having recited <i>hamotzi</i> on other bread first.<br>Second, when one eats sandwiches using such bread or eats it with other foods, one may easily eat more than four <i>k'beitzot</i> of food, and that, as explained above, is problematic according to certain authorities.</i>"

Thus, with regard to bread, it is to a large part analogous to Halachah 11.<br>In this context, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> asks why the Rambam did not mention these laws in the context of Chapter 3, Halachot 5-7, which state the rule that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that those halachot describe a situation where the person has no desire to eat the secondary food in its own right and eats it only because of the primary food. In this halachah, the Rambam is speaking about an instance in which one desires to eat the other foods; nevertheless, they are included in the blessing recited over bread because bread includes all other foods.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> offers a different interpretation, which appears more appropriate to the context in which the laws are discussed. Here, the Rambam is speaking only about the blessing recited after eating.</i> the appetizers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary on the Mishnah,<i>Berachot</i> 6:5 (the source for this halachah), the Rambam defines the term פרפרת as לפתן, which is generally translated as \"relish.\" Note the <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 176:1), which offer a different interpretation of the term פרפרת.</i> eaten together with bread<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This does not refer only to instances when these foods are eaten while placed on bread, but also to times when they are eaten at a meal at which bread is served.</i> - e.g., cooked food or fruit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because the main element of a meal is considered to be bread, reciting a blessing upon it - either before or after partaking of it - includes the other foods that are eaten together with it.</i> Reciting a blessing on these foods, however, does not include bread.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries question why this clause is necessary according to the Rambam's definition of פרפרת. It is obvious that bread would not be considered secondary to any other foods.</i><br>Reciting a blessing on cooked grains<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>) and on Chapter 3, Halachah 4.</i> includes cooked food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the cooked grains are considered \"sustaining food\" and have been granted a special blessing which includes (in synopsis) all the blessings of grace, reciting a blessing over them includes other cooked dishes eaten with them.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> emphasizes that this applies to cooked foods that are eaten together with the grains. Otherwise, it would be difficult to understand how the blessing for the grains could cover foods that require other blessings. Note also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, which offers an alternate explanation.</i> Reciting a blessing on cooked food, however, does not include cooked grains.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since these cooked foods are not as satisfying as grains, the blessing recited over them cannot include grains.<br>Several commentaries have raised the question that from <i>Berachot</i> 42b, it appears that the Rambam's decision follows the School of Shammai and not the School of Hillel. The clearest resolution of the difficulty is offered by the <i>Rishon LeTzion</i>, who explains that the Rambam's decision is based on the Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:5). When the passage from the Babylonian Talmud is studied in the light of the passage from the Jerusalem Talmud, the Rambam's ruling is no longer difficult.<br>This relates to a concept frequently discussed by students of the Rambam: Does the Rambam accept the principle that when there is a difference of opinion between the Babylonian Talmud and the Jerusalem Talmud, the Halachah follows the Babylonian Talmud, or not?</i>"

Accordingly, the respect due to the Sabbath adds importance to the diversion of our attention from drinking implied by the statement, \"Let us recite <i>kiddush</i>.\" In contrast, <i>havdalah</i> marks the beginning of the week, which we are not required to treat with such distinction. Thus, as <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 29:12 states, a person is not required to interrupt his meal at nightfall on Saturday, but may continue and recite <i>havdalah</i> when he concludes eating (Radbaz).<br>24. <i>Berachot</i> 59b emphasizes that this blessing is recited only when one drinks in a company. When one drinks alone, this blessing should not be recited, because it praises God for \"being good\" - i.e., to me - and \"doing good\" - for others (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 175:4).25. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) notes that the Sages instituted this blessing only for different types of wine and not for different types of bread or meat, since wine has two positive qualities: It satisfies a person's appetite and lifts his spirits.26. Rashi, <i>Berachot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), states that this blessing should be recited only when the second type of wine is better than the first. If the first type of wine is better, no blessing should be recited. The commentaries maintain that the Rambam differs and maintains that the blessing should be recited whenever one changes types of wine. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 175:2-3) rules that if one knows that the second type of wine is of a lesser quality than the first, the blessing should not be recited.</i>"

            "english": "Foods that are eaten within the meal, because of the meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements are quoted, with slight changes, from <i>Berachot</i> 41b. In his commentary on this passage, Rashi defines this first category of foods as relishes eaten with bread. He explains that other foods - e.g., cereals or vegetables - although they are eaten as part of a meal, require an independent blessing.<br><i>Tosafot</i> differs, and maintains that any food that is eaten as part of a meal - e.g., the foods mentioned by Rashi, meat or fish - is included in this category. Even if they are not eaten with bread, merely at the same meal, they</i> do not require a blessing beforehand or afterward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries question whether the Rambam's position follows that of Rashi or <i>Tosafot</i>. The following sentence (which is the Rambam's addition to <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) sheds light on the question.</i> Rather, the blessing <i>hamotzi</i> that is recited in the beginning and the grace recited afterward include everything, because everything is secondary to the meal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This sentence explains the rationale for this ruling. These foods are not eaten casually during the day, but rather are eaten only as part of a meal, with the intent of satiating one's appetite. Accordingly, they are considered as secondary to bread, which is the primary element of the meal (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 177:1). Accordingly, we follow the ruling mentioned in Chapter 3, Halachah 5, that the blessing on primary foods includes secondary foods.<br>This explanation appears to indicate that the Rambam follows<i>Tosafot's</i> interpretation. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 171:1) also rules accordingly. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:1, however, postulates that it is logical to assume that this ruling applies only when bread is eaten throughout the meal. If only a small amount of bread is eaten at the beginning of a meal, and no bread is eaten while the main course is being eaten, it is questionable whether the blessing over the bread covers these foods.</i><br>Foods that are eaten within the meal, but do not come because of the meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to fruits and the like, which are not satisfying food and are eaten throughout the day, frequently outside the context of a meal, but at times within the context of a meal. This indicates that they are not necessarily connected with the meal and, therefore, are not included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>. Accordingly, they</i> require a blessing before partaking of them, but do not require a blessing afterward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since they are eaten within the meal, they also satisfy a person's appetite. Accordingly, they are included in the blessing that is required by the commandment, \"When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall bless....\"<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:1,3, based on Rabbenu Asher's commentary on <i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions two instances when fruit is included in the blessing <i>hamotzi</i>:<br>a) When the fruits are eaten on bread itself,b) When one eats a meal of fruit - i.e., the fruit is served to satiate one's appetite.</i><br>Foods that are eaten after the meal, whether because of the meal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., foods served to satiate one's appetite</i> or independent of the meal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">fruits, desserts, or drinks</i> require a blessing beforehand and afterward.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) states that this law does not apply at present. Our eating habits have changed, and bread is constantly before us during a meal, and it is customary to partake of it at all times.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) accepts <i>Tosafot's</i> position. The <i>Magen Avraham</i> 177:7 adds that even at large feasts, when it is customary to eat desert without eating bread, a new blessing is not required because, in Talmudic times, bread and the main course were served on a small table, which was then removed, and dessert was served on a new table. Thus, the dessert appeared as a separate meal and required separate blessings. In contrast, at present, desert is served on the same table on which the bread was served. Hence, it is still considered a continuation of the same meal and does not require a separate blessing.</i>"

Nevertheless, in practice, it is agreed that women should mention both these mitzvot, because the ultimate fulfillment of the creation of both men and women is when they marry. Therefore, a man and his wife are considered a single unit (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 187:7).</i> There is a doubt whether their obligation stems from the Torah, since [this is a positive mitzvah] that is not linked to a specific time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Women are not obligated to fulfill such mitzvot. See <i>Kiddushin</i> (1:7). Since the obligation to recite grace is constant, whether one eats during the day or at night, it would appear that women are obligated. Some commentaries point to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 19) and the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 3:3 and <i>Kiddushin</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) as indications that the Rambam supports the view that a woman's obligation for grace stems from the Torah.</i> or whether their obligation does not stem from the Torah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 20b explains this hypothesis: Since Deuteronomy 8:10, the proof-text requiring us to recite grace, states: \"You shall bless God, your Lord, for the good land that He gave you,\" one might think that only those who were given an inheritance in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> are required to recite grace, thus excluding women who were not given an inheritance.</i> Therefore,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., because of this doubt</i> they should not<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">endeavor to</i> fulfill the obligation of grace on behalf of others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since, as stated in Chapter 1, Halachah 11, a person can only recite a blessing on behalf of another person if he shares an equal obligation himself.</i> Children,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Boys below thirteen and girls below twelve, or individuals above that age who have not demonstrated signs of physical maturity.</i> however, are obligated to recite grace<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression appears to indicate that the Sages placed the obligation on the child himself.

(In <i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:13 and <i>Hilchot Chagigah</i> 2:3, however, the Rambam states that the obligation to train a child to fulfill these mitzvot lies on the father.)<br>The hypothesis that the obligation lies on the child is supported by Halachah 16, which states that a child may fulfill the obligation of grace for a person who did not eat to the point of satisfaction (and, therefore, is obligated to recite grace only by Rabbinic decree). Were the Sages to have placed the obligation to educate the child on his father and not on the child himself, the child would not be able to fulfill the mitzvah on behalf of another person.<br>Nevertheless, it is possible to explain that the Sages placed the obligation on the father. This obligation, however, encompasses the child and, hence, causes him to be considered as obligated in the mitzvah (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. 17).</i> by virtue of Rabbinic decree,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">until a child reaches intellectual maturity, the Torah itself places no obligations upon him (<i>Pesachim</i> 116a).</i> in order to educate them to perform mitzvot."

In contrast, since each person may fulfill his obligation to recite grace without a <i>zimmun</i>, leniencies were granted in counting the people included.<br>Rabbenu Asher and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 199:10) do not accept this distinction, and rule that a child may not be counted in a <i>zimun</i> until he is thirteen years of age and has exhibited signs of physical maturity.</i> A gentile may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even when we are certain that he will bless God.<br>In his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:1, based on <i>Berachot</i> 47b), the Rambam states that this refers to a gentile who has already made a decision to convert and has been circumcised for that reason. Nevertheless, if he has not immersed himself in the mikveh, he is not considered a Jew, and may not be included in a <i>zimmun</i>.14. This ruling is not accepted by many other authorities, including Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi and Rabbenu Asher. Because of the difference of opinion, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:3) rules that, at the outset, an attempt should be made to follow the Rambam's decision. If, however, the third person does not desire to eat bread, he may be included in the <i>zimmun</i> as long as he partook of a<i>k'zayit</i> of other foods.15. The commentaries note that the Rambam does not quote <i>Berachot</i> 48a (the source for this halachah) exactly. The Talmud states \"dipped his food in brine with them.\" The Rambam's choice of phraseology is particularly difficult since, as the Rambam himself writes in <i>Hilchot Sh'vitat Asor</i> 2:5, brine is generally not eaten alone as a food.16. The commentaries have noted the apparent redundancy in the Rambam's expressions. The <i>Kol ben Levi</i> offers a possible resolution, explaining that, in the opening clause, the Rambam states that these people are not required to make a <i>zimmun</i>. In the final clause, he states that they are not allowed to do so. 17. <i>Tosafot, Berachot</i> 47a, writes that if they have already decided to recite grace, the third person may not be included in a<i>zimmun</i> with them. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 197:1) accepts this ruling.18. According to the Rambam's opinion mentioned in the previous halachah, the third person must partake of bread. According to the other opinions mentioned above, if the third person partakes of other foods, the first two may include him in a <i>zimmun</i>.19. <i>Berachot</i> 47a relates that Rav Simai bar Chiyya joined Rav and Shemuel in a meal after the latter had completed eating. They ate another side dish together with him, and then recited the <i>zimmun</i>.20. Note the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 197, which states that they are obligated to recite the <i>zimmun</i>.21. He may, however, convey this privilege on another person if he desires (<i>Tosafot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>; <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 201:1).<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) mentions that if a guest is present, he should be given the privilege of reciting the<i>zimmun</i>, so that he will be able to recite a blessing for the host, as mentioned in Chapter 2, Halachah 7.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>:2) also mentions that a priest who is a Torah sage should be given the privilege of reciting the <i>zimmun</i>. (See <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 4:2 and <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 12:18.)<br>22. Although a sufficient number of people to recite grace with a<i>zimmun</i> will remain, each individual is personally obligated to participate in the <i>zimmun</i> and may not recite grace alone.23. Enough people remain in each group to allow them both to recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i>. There is, however, no obligation to separate. If the people desire, they may recite grace in a single group (Ramah, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1).24. Until there are twenty people, separation will prevent - at the very least - the people who separate from reciting grace with God's name.<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 193:1, based on<i>Berachot</i> 50a) states that, at a meal attended by many people, if there is a difficulty or inconvenience preventing an individual from participating in the <i>zimmun</i> in which God's name is mentioned, he may recite grace with a <i>zimmun</i> of three.</i>"

If a fourth person joined the two remaining in the original group and a <i>zimmun</i> was recited, the obligation of a <i>zimmun</i> is no longer incumbent on the person who left the group. Therefore, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited in the new group of three (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:6).<br>If the three people in the new group eat together as a company, they may recite a <i>zimmun</i> (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:33).</i><br>When three people sit down [together] to eat bread, they may not separate<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">even though one of the three desires to recite grace before the others, they must recite the <i>zimmun</i> as a group (<i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 193:28).</i> even though each person eats from his own food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is the intent to sit down together at a single table that establishes them as a company, and not the fact that they share food.<br>25. This halachah describes a large feast, at which many people eat at different tables. Nevertheless, they all came together for the same purpose, and thus are considered a single group. (See the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Berachot</i> 7:5; and <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 195:2).<br>In contrast, in a restaurant, although many people eat in the same room, since they did not come with the intention of eating together, they are considered as a single group. 26. The Rambam is quoting the Mishnah (<i>Berachot</i> 7:5). Rabbenu Asher and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 195:1) state that the same principles apply if the feast is held in two separate rooms (or houses), as long as they are not separated by a street.27. Similarly, if a single group is large enough to prevent the words of the blessings from being heard, people should recite the <i>zimmun</i> in smaller groups (<i>Kessef Mishneh; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 193:1). 28. He must also respond (<i>Berachot</i> 45b; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 194:6).29. He fulfills his obligation for <i>zimmun</i>, but not for grace.30. It is only proper that God's name be mentioned when the ten people are in the same room (<i>Berachot</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>). 31. If, however, two people from a group of three recite grace alone, a <i>zimmun</i> may not be recited (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 194:1).32. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 194:1) states that this law only applies when the individual has not answered to a <i>zimmun</i> previously. If, however, he answered to the <i>zimmun</i> of a previous group, he may not be included in this <i>zimmun</i>.33. He should respond as usual.34. <i>Zimmun</i> should precede grace. Once a person has recited grace, he can no longer fulfill his obligation for <i>zimmun</i><br>.</i>"

Rabbenu Asher (<i>Berachot</i>, Chapter 9) explains that this term was used because in Talmudic times, the utensil with which it was customary to wash one's hands was called נטלא.

At present, this practice is generally not followed.2. There are no fruits that are eaten as <i>terumah</i> according to Torah law. (It is wine and oil, not grapes and olives, which carry such an obligation.) Therefore, the Sages did not impose an obligation to wash before eating from such food if it was not consecrated (Rabbenu Yonah, <i>Berachot</i> 8).3. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 181:1), the Ra'avad, and others offer a different rationale for this washing, quoting <i>Berachot</i> 53a's interpretation of Leviticus 11:44: \"'Make yourselves holy,' this refers to the first washing; 'And you shall be holy,' this refers to the second washing.\" They explain that this washing is necessary as a token of respect to clean one's hands before reciting grace.4.

The Rabbis, however, obligated the use of a <i>mikveh</i> of 40 <i>se'ah</i> for all ritual immersions.</i> for each pair of hands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's decision differs from that of the Ra'avad, Rashi, the Rashba, and many other authorities. The other authorities maintain that as long as the vessel from which the water is poured contains a <i>revi'it</i>, two people may have their hands washed from it. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:13) accepts the latter view.<br>Significantly, the Rambam mentions washing the hands only once before partaking of food. In <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 11:3, where he mentions the washing of the hands within the context of ritual purity, he mentions the need to wash hands twice: once to purify the hands, and once to wash off the water used to purify them. (See Halachah 10 and commentary.) In these halachot, he makes no mention of a second washing, seeming to imply that it is unnecessary to do so. (Rav Kapach adds that it is customary in certain Yemenite groups to wash only once before meals, and bases this practice on the Rambam's decision.)<br>The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> and the Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 162:2) mention washing the hands two or three times before partaking of a meal.

Any substance that covers the major portion of one's flesh nullifies the immersion, even though it does not disturb one.<br>In Chapter 2 of those halachot, the Rambam mentions a long list of particular substances that nullify immersions, including filth, mud, and dough.</i> is also considered an intervening substance with regard to washing hands.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This implies that one should clean one's hands before washing them for this ritual purpose.

I.e., whether before a meal or in preparation for prayer.6. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that this expression indicates that it is not necessary to wash one's hands a second time (see the commentary on the previous halachah) or to dry them before partaking of the food. When washing one's hands for food, this is required because the water used for the first washing that remains on the hands becomes ritually impure. In contrast, the water that remains on one's hands after immersion in a <i>mikveh</i> is pure. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch</i>, <i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:19.)7. A <i>mikveh</i> must have at least 40 <i>se'ah</i> of water that has flowed into it by natural means. In contemporary measurements, 331 liters according to <i>Shiurei Torah</i>, and 648 liters according to the <i>Chazon Ish</i>.<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> notes that this applies only to water that does not emanate from a natural spring. When a person immerses his hands in such a spring, all that is necessary is that there be sufficient water to cover his hands. (See also <i>Hilchot Mikveot</i> 9:8.)<br>Significantly, Rabbenu Yonah maintains that it is acceptable to immerse one's hands in a <i>mikveh</i> containing even less than 40 <i>se'ah</i>. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 159:14) accepts this view, although the Ramah favors the Rambam's position.<br>8. The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, and maintains that one may immerse one's hands in water poured into a pool in the ground. He supports his position by referring to the immersion of a <i>ba'al keri</i> (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 4:4-5), which is acceptable even in such pool. (See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Mikveot</i> 8:1.) Nevertheless, most authorities accept the Rambam's decision. (See <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 159:23; <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 159.) 9. See Halachot 7-9.10. See Halachot 4 and 10.11. See Halachot 11-12. The Rashba quotes the <i>Halachot Gedolot</i> as explaining that it is necessary to wash with a vessel, because the washing of hands is derived from the sanctification of the priest's hands in the Temple.12. See Halachot 13-14.13. The <i>Beit Yosef</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) states that this concept is derived from the laws of the <i>ki'or</i> (the basin in the Temple from which the priests washed their hands). If its water changed color, it could no longer be used.14. E.g., ink or another coloring fell into it.15. It became rusty from a metal container. Note, however, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:22, which state that water that has become murky from mud or dirt is acceptable, because even this is often the color of natural stream water.<br>If after water was disqualified because of an abnormal color, its color reverts to the norm, it can be used to wash one's hands (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:1; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:5).<br>16. See <i>Hilchot Rotzeach USh'mirat HaNefesh</i> 11:6-16, which discusseshe prohibition of water left uncovered. This prohibition was enacted out of fear of the possibility that a poisonous snake or the like released venom into the water.17. <i>Avodah Zarah</i> 30b states that washing with such water could be dangerous lest the venom seep into cuts or sores or even through the body's pores. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160) notes that since the presence of poisonous snakes and the like is no longer widespread, the prohibition against drinking - and hence, washing with - such water need not be observed at present. This ruling is accepted by the later authorities.18. The Rambam is implying that the water in a <i>mikveh</i> or in a natural stream remains acceptable for washing although it was used for other tasks (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).19. If, however, the bread fell into the water accidentally, the water is not disqualified (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:2; <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:8).20. The Ramah (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:2) states that even if the baker washed his hands in the water, the water does not become unacceptable. The <i>Turei Zahav</i> (160:3) refutes this ruling. His opinion is accepted by the later authorities. 21. Slightly murky water is acceptable, as mentioned above. The determining factor is whether or not a dog will drink from the water.22. Since a <i>mikveh</i> containing such water is acceptable for the immersion of one's entire body, it is surely acceptable for the immersion of hands, which is only a Rabbinic commandment.23. These hot springs have a high mineral content and are very bitter.24. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to a stream that was diverted into a trench that does not contain forty <i>se'ah</i>. Although logically, this would be acceptable for the immersion of hands, the Sages forbade using such water, lest one also immerse one's hands in a container of water. Significantly, in his <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 160:7), Rav Yosef Karo adds a further point, that the water was cut off from its source.25. I.e., the washing before partaking of bread.26. I.e., the washing after the meal (see Halachah 17); alternatively, the second pouring of water over one's hands, as mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4. Note the explanation of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>. 27. In both instances, one must pour at least a <i>revi'it</i> of water over one's hands in a single pouring. In the first instance, while the water is being poured one gradually moves one's hands under the water, while in the second instance, one pours hurriedly, but forcefully, over the entire hand at once.28. I.e., several people stand with their hands outstretched, and a person passes in front of them pouring water over their hands.29. Although the water first passes over the hands of one person, it is still acceptable for the person whose hands are held below, because as long as it contains the required quantity and comes in one continuous stream, it does not become impure.<br>Nevertheless, <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 160:16 and the <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 160:68,72 state that the two people must originally have the intention to wash their hands as one, and must hold their hands close together. Otherwise, it is considered as if the second person washed with the water that was rendered impure by the first person's washing.<br>30. Note the difference of opinion on this issue between the Rambam and the other Halachic authorities mentioned in the commentary on Halachah 4.</i> of hands]."

Alternatively, the expression בכל מאדך [can be associated with the words בכל מדה and interpreted to mean] for every measure that He deals you be very, very thankful to Him.<br>On this Mishnah, the Rambam comments:<br>[The Mishnah] states: In the same manner as one blesses Him for good... [i.e.,] he should accept them with happiness, overcome his feelings, and compose his mind when reciting the blessing <i>Dayan ha'emet</i> to the extent that he should appear in the same state as when reciting the blessing <i>hatov v’hameitiv</i>.Our Sages declared... \"Everything Heaven does is for good.\"... Although many matters may originally look unfavorable, ultimately they will bring great good. Conversely, there are many things which, at the outset, appear good, and ultimately are very bad. Therefore, an understanding person should not become aggrieved when beset with difficulties... because he does not know the ultimate outcome.A person should concentrate his thoughts [on the following objective] and ask God [for it to be realized]: That everything that happens to him in this world, both positive and unfavorable occurrences, should be with the intent of bringing him the ultimate happiness, [a portion in the world to come].</i>"

It is, nevertheless, worthy of question why the Rambam lists the mitzvot of sukkah, <i>lulav</i>, and <i>shofar</i> in this order. In Hilchot Shofar V'Sukkah V'Lulav, he discusses them in a different order.</i> These are referred to as obligations, since a person is obligated to fulfill them.<br>There are other mitzvot that are not obligations, but resemble voluntary activities - for example, [the mitzvot of] <i>mezuzah</i> and constructing a guardrail. A person is not obligated to dwell in a house that requires a <i>mezuzah</i><sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot</i> mezuzah 6:1.

Similarly, he does not have to build a house [just] in order to build a guardrail.<br>A blessing should be recited<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud (<i>Berachot</i> 6:1) derives the obligation to recite a blessing before fulfilling mitzvot as follows: Exodus 24:12 establishes an equation between Torah study and the mitzvot. Therefore, since blessings are recited before Torah study (see <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 7:10), a blessing should also be recited before fulfilling a mitzvah. It must, however, be emphasized that this is an <i>asmachtah</i> and the obligation to recite these blessings originates in Rabbinic law and not in the Torah itself.</i> before<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam, there is one exception to this principle: the ritual immersion of a convert, as explained in Halachah 7. Although other authorities maintain that the blessing before washing hands should be recited after washing and not beforehand, as mentioned in Chapter 6, Halachah 2, the Rambam does not agree, and requires that this blessing also be recited before fulfilling the mitzvah.</i> fulfilling all positive commandments that are between man and God,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements imply that a blessing should not be recited before fulfilling any of the mitzvot between man and man. The Rabbis have given several explanations why blessings are not recited before fulfilling such commandments:<br>a) A blessing is recited only when a person can fulfill a mitzvah on his own, without requiring the assistance of another person. Many of the mitzvot between man and man require a recipient - e.g., charity cannot be given without a poor man being willing to receive it, a lost object cannot be returned unless its owner accepts it (Rashba, Vol. I, Responsum 18).<br>b) Many of the mitzvot between man and man (e.g., visiting the sick, comforting mourners, giving charity) were instituted because of undesirable circumstances. Hence, it is not appropriate that a blessing be recited in connection with them (Rav David Avudraham).<br>[Although as stated in the previous chapter, a person is obligated to recite a blessing when undesirable events occur to him, it is not appropriate to do so when such events happen to a colleague. Should a person do so, he would appear to be rejoicing in his colleague's misfortune.]<br>c) The gentiles are also obligated to give charity and establish a stable society. Hence, they fulfill many of the positive commandments. Thus, the blessing recited before fulfilling a mitzvah, praising God for sanctifying - i.e., differentiating - \"us with Your commandments\" is inappropriate (<i>Torah Temimah</i>).</i> whether they are mitzvot that are obligatory or are not obligatory."

Note also the objection of the Ra'avad to the Rambam's statements in Halachah 2 of that chapter.</i> Blessings are not recited over an [obligation that was instituted] because of danger.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a slight difficulty with the Rambam's statements. In Halachot 9 and 12, the Rambam states that a blessing is recited when one fulfills the mitzvah of constructing a guardrail. On the surface, the purpose of that mitzvah is to prevent danger. This question can, however, be resolved on the basis of <i>Hilchot Tefillah</i> 9:7, which states:<br>One who says... \"May He who showed mercy on a bird's nest... show mercy on us\"... should be silenced, because these mitzvot are God's decrees and are not [expressions of] mercy.<br>Although the obvious reason for the mitzvah of chasing away the mother bird is to show mercy (and the Rambam himself gives such an explanation in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 38), that mitzvah - and every mitzvah - is ultimately a Divine decree that surpasses human intellect. Any rationale we provide is limited and cannot define the mitzvah in a complete manner.<br>The same applies in the present instance. Although the obvious reason for constructing a guardrail is to prevent a dangerous situation from arising, this nevertheless represents only man's conception of the mitzvah. God's purpose is beyond our comprehension. Therefore, a Rabbinic ordinance like washing after the meal can be considered as having been established because of danger, and, for that reason, a blessing is not recited in connection with its performance. In contrast, with regard to a commandment from the Torah itself, there is no way that we can define the ultimate purpose for its performance and consider it as having been granted us only to avoid danger (<i>Kinat Eliyahu</i>). [See also <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. IX. Note also that although the Rambam and the <i>She'iltot</i> of Rav Achai Gaon mention reciting a blessing over the construction of a guardrail, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i>, Chapter 427) does not mention this blessing.]</i><br>To what can this be compared? To someone who strains drinking water at night because of the danger of leeches. [Surely,] he does not recite a blessing, [praising God,] \"who commanded us to strain water.\" The same applies in all similar situations."

[This applies] even to a custom established by the prophets - for example, taking the willow branches on the seventh day of Sukkot.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Lulav</i> 7:20-22 relates that while the Temple was standing, willow branches were placed near the altar on each of the seven days of the Sukkot festival, with the exception of the Sabbath. At present, to commemorate that practice, it is customary to take willow branches on the seventh day of the holiday and hit them five times against the ground.</i> Needless to say, a blessing is not recited over customs established by the Sages - e.g., reading <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on the festivals, which the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Chanukah</i> 3:6) considers a mitzvah instituted by the Sages, the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh was not uniformly accepted among the Jewish community in Talmudic times. Thus, <i>Ta'anit</i> 28b relates that the great Sage Rav was not accustomed to reciting <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh. Rather, it is a custom that was practiced in Babylon for years, and ultimately became universally accepted. Therefore, certain portions are not recited and a blessing is not recited.<br>The Ra'avad and <i>Tosafot, Ta'anit</i> (<i>ibid.</i>) differ and maintain that, in contrast to taking the willow, which is not an involved practice, the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> is worthy of a blessing. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 422:2) quotes the Rambam's opinion and states that it is the accepted practice in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. In contrast, the Ramah follows the other view.</i> and on the intermediate days of Pesach.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since there was no special sacrifice ordained for each of the latter days of Pesach individually, but rather the same sacrifices were offered throughout the festival, the full <i>Hallel</i> is not recited. The same laws that govern the recitation of <i>Hallel</i> on Rosh Chodesh apply.</i><br>Similarly whenever there is a question whether a practice requires a blessing or not,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and other commentaries give several examples of such practices:<br>a) Separating tithes from produce that is classified as <i>d'mai</i> (produce sold by an unlearned person). The Sages required this separation as a safeguard, because they were unsure whether the unlearned person had separated the tithes or not. Although the tithes should be separated because of this doubt, since it is possible that they had been separated previously, a blessing should not be recited.<br>b) Covering the blood of a <i>kvi</i>. The Sages were unsure whether such an animal should be classified as a <i>behemah</i>, whose blood should not be covered, or as a <i>chayah</i>, whose blood must be covered. Because of the doubt, we cover the animal's blood. We do not, however, recite a blessing (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 14:4).<br>c) Dwelling in the <i>sukkah</i> on Shemini Atzeret. Although it is customary to dwell in the <i>sukkah</i> on this day in the diaspora, in deference to the possibility that Sukkot actually began on the second day, a blessing is not recited. (See <i>Hilchot Sukkah</i> 6:13.)</i> it should be performed without reciting a blessing.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The blessing is not recited lest the deed one performs not be necessary, and thus the blessing one recites would be considered as taking God's name in vain.<br>Note the question of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> concerning the Rambam's decision (<i>Hilchot Kri'at Shema</i>13 2:13) that a person who is unsure whether he recited the <i>Shema</i> should recite its blessings as well.</i><br>A person should always take care not to recite blessings that are not necessary, and should recite many blessings that are required. Thus, David declared [Psalms 145:2]: \"I will bless you each day.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sukkah</i> 46a quotes a similar verse and comments, \"Each day, respond to Him in a manner that reflects His blessings.\"<br>The Rambam appears to be implying that a person should be continuously aware of the kindness God is granting him and respond by blessing Him.</i>"
