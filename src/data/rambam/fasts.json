            "english": "It is a positive Torah commandment<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 59), which mentions this in the reckoning of the 613 mitzvot of the Torah.<br>Significantly, however, the Rambam's appreciation of this mitzvah differs in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> from that in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>. To explain: Following the verse quoted here by the Rambam as a proof-text, the Torah continues [Numbers 10:10]: \"On the days of your rejoicing, on your festivals, and on your new moon [celebrations], you shall sound the trumpets for your burnt offerings and for your peace offerings.\"<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam writes:We are commanded to sound the trumpets in the Temple when offering sacrifices that are offered only at appointed times.... [Also,] we are commanded to sound the trumpets at a time of distress and difficulty when we pray to Him.In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (and similarly in <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, Mitzvah 384), the emphasis of the mitzvah is clearly on the sounding of the trumpets during the sacrifices. In the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, when listing the 613 mitzvot at the beginning of the text, the Rambam mentions the sounding of the trumpets both for the sacrifices and in times of distress. Nevertheless, further on in the beginning of the text, when delineating the mitzvot according to subjects, he places the emphasis on crying out to God at a time of distress (seemingly, including crying out verbally and crying out with the trumpets in the same mitzvah). Significantly, in <i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i>, Chapter 3, where the Rambam mentions the practice of sounding the trumpets in connection with the offering of the sacrifices, he does not mention it as a component of this or any other specific mitzvah.<br>(Note also the commentary of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i>, which questions why these two different rites were included as a single mitzvah at the outset. Even in the Torah, they are included in two separate verses.)</i> to cry out<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">in prayer. Our Sages (<i>Sifre, VaEtchanan</i>) explain that זעקה is one of the ten verbs used for prayer.</i> and to sound<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verb להריע refers to the sounding of a series of staccato notes referred to as <i>teru'ah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Shofar</i> 3:2-4. Significantly, although in practice, both types of notes were sounded, with regard to the sounding of the trumpets at the offerings, the Torah uses the verb ותקעתם, which refers to sounding a <i>teki'ah</i>, a single long note.</i> trumpets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the Temple, these were made of silver (<i>Hilchot Klei HaMikdash</i> 3:5). Josephus describes them as being approximately a cubit long, slightly thicker than an ordinary flute, and having a bell-like end. It is questionable whether it was necessary for them to be silver outside the Temple as well.<br>See also the Ramban (<i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i>), who mentions an opinion that the shofar, and not a trumpet, should be sounded in time of communal distress. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> also notes this opinion and states that either instrument, a shofar or a trumpet, is acceptable, but that - outside of the Temple premises - only one of the two should be used in time of distress. Some support for this position can be drawn from Halachah 6.</i> in the event of any difficulty that arises which affects the community, as [Numbers 10:9] states: \"[When you go out to war... against] an enemy who attacks you and you sound the trumpets....\"<br>[This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As obvious from Halachah 4, this practice was observed throughout <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, and not only in the Temple. Nor is its observance dependent on the existence of the Temple, nor does the Rambam specify that it must be fulfilled only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. (In this regard, there are differing opinions; see <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 576:1) Accordingly, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 576:1 questions: Why is the rite of sounding the trumpets (or shofarot) not observed at present?<br>The resolution of this question lies in the Rambam's words, \"any difficulty that arises which affects the community.\" This rite should not be observed when an individual, or even a group of individuals, are in distress, but only when a \"community\" is affected.<br><i>Pesachim</i> 54b explains that communal fasts are possible only within <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. There is no concept of taking such a unified communal act of this nature in the diaspora. Therefore, this mitzvah was not relevant in all the generations of our people's existence in the diaspora. (See also the <i>Drashot l'Rosh HaShanah</i> of the Ramban.)<br>A question arises, however, with regard to the situation at present, with the renewal of the Jewish settlement in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. As explained in the commentary on Chapter 3, Halachah 11, there are opinions (see the gloss of the <i>Birkei Yosef</i> to the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> 575) that maintain that at present, the concept of community also applies in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>According to this view, without entering into the discussion regarding the halachic status of the present government, it would appear that it would be proper for this mitzvah to be observed, since its observance is not dependent on the Temple.</i> commandment is not restricted to such a limited scope;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., it does not apply to war alone, as might be understood from the verse.</i> rather] the intent is: Whenever you are distressed by difficulties<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">e.g., famine, plague - Note <i>Ta'anit</i> 22b, which states that the trumpets should not be sounded in the case of a plague even during the week. Since a plague is a very severe matter, were the trumpets to be sounded during the week, they might also be sounded when a plague took place on the Sabbath, and thus a prohibition would be violated. The Rambam discusses this question in his Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Ta'anit</i> 3:3). Similarly, in Chapter 2, Halachah 1, the Rambam rules that the trumpets are sounded when a plague occurs.</i> - e.g., famine, plague, locusts, or the like<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., circumstances that cause distress to the community as a whole.</i> - cry out [to God] because of them and sound the trumpets.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i> 2:6, where the Rambam gives the assurance that if the Jews cry out to God as a community, He will surely heed their prayers.</i>"

At that time, Jacob and his family had grain, but the others did not, and Jacob did not want to arouse ill-feeling.<br>The Talmud (<i>ibid.</i> 11a) concludes its discussion of this issue with the following principle: Whoever separates himself from the community will not witness their being comforted. In contrast, one who joins in their distress will merit to join in their being comforted.</i>"
