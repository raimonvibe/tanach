Moreover, even if the meat is cut off as the Rambam suggests, the animal will become ritually impure, because there is an unresolved doubt whether our Sages decreed that any animal that is removed from the Temple Courtyard becomes ritually impure. Hence, because of the doubt, we should rule stringently (see <i>Pesachim</i> 85a). The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and Rav Yosef Corcus resolve the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>With regard to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity, there is no need to cut off [the meat]. Instead, he should bring its foot back inside [the Temple Courtyard], and receive the blood. For [even] if meat from sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity were taken out [of the Temple Courtyard] before their blood was cast [on the altar], [the sacrifice] is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Provided of course that the animal was returned to the Temple Courtyard, and the blood received there. Even if a portion of the animal was outside the Courtyard, as long as the blood was received inside the Temple Courtyard, the sacrifice is not disqualified. Nevertheless, the portion that was outside the Temple Courtyard is forbidden to be eaten (see Halachah 32).<br>The Ra'avad states that after the blood was cast on the altar, the meat may be taken out of the Temple Courtyard. Rav Yosef Corcus states that this is obvious, because the meat of sacrifices of a less degree of sanctity may be eaten throughout the city of Jerusalem (<i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 11:5-6).</i>"

Originally [i.e., in the first version of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Temurah</i> 4:3)], he accepted the opinion of Rav Abba who made his statements in the name of Rav. According to that view, if he sacrificed the animal that was set aside originally, the second animal that was set aside need not be consigned to death.

Hence he suggests amending the text to read: \"If, [after it was redeemed,] the blemished one was slaughtered before the blood of the unblemished one was cast [upon the altar], it is permitted. [If it was slaughtered] after [the blood of the first] was cast upon the altar, it is forbidden to benefit from [the blemished one].\"</i> If they were both blemished, they should both be sold, a sin-offering should be purchased from the proceeds, and the remainder used for freewill offerings.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 5, Halachah 3.</i>"

It appears that the Rambam is saying that all of the doves, even those which are disqualified, should be offered on the lower half of the altar. The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam, asking how is it possible for him to suggest that unacceptable doves should be offered as sacrifices. (If, he states, the Rambam's intent was that all of the sin-offerings should be offered on the bottom half of the altar, that is obvious and does not need the introduction \"It appears to me.\")<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that with the expression \"It appears to me,\" the Rambam is introducing a new idea. The previous halachah is speaking about an instance where the priest offered only half the doves in the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar. If, however, he offers more than half of the doves (half of the unspecified group and the number of doves designated as sin-offerings that became intermingled with them) on the lower half of the altar, not only is half the unspecified group acceptable, the sin-offerings that became mixed with the unspecified group are also acceptable. The priest is allowed to offer the majority of the unspecified group on the lower half of the altar because the other doves were never specified as burnt-offerings. Although they would have to be offered as burnt-offerings (and hence, are disqualified), since they were never specified as such, they may be offered on the lower half of the altar. Rav Yosef Corcus adds that according to the Rambam, the intent is the sacrifices are acceptable. It is just that the owners can fulfill their obligation only for half of them.</i>"

In the previous halachah, we are speaking about an instance where the woman defined which doves were to be offered for which sacrifice at the time she gave them to the priest to offer and the priest forgot how he had offered them. In this instance, in addition to defining them when giving them to the priest, she pledged to bring them from a specific type and then she forgot which type of doves she pledged to bring for each particular sacrifice.</i> [which types of doves to be offered to fulfill] her vow, saying: \"If I give birth to a male, I pledge two turtle doves,\" and she gave birth and brought four doves:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Of one type, as stated below.</i> two for her vow and two for her obligation. The priest offered two on the upper portion [of the altar] and two on the lower portion, but did not know which were offered on the upper portion and which were offered on the lower portion and she also forgot and did not know the type of doves she had pledged for her vow, whether turtle doves or young doves. She should bring two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The doves offered previously as a burnt-offering are of no consequence, because we are not certain that her vow was fulfilled. Because she is in doubt regarding which type she had specified in her vow, she must bring both types to fulfill it.</i> [All] four should be offered on the upper portion of the altar. She should bring another dove to complete her obligation and it should be offered on the lower portion. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>loc. cit.</i>), the Rambam explains that this follows the same rationale as above. One of the burnt-offerings is acceptable. Hence it is necessary to bring a sin-offering to complete her obligation. He continues explaining that this decision is somewhat of a leniency, because it is possible that she will be offering the sin-offering from a different type of dove than the burnt-offering. Nevertheless, since we do not know of which type the original four doves were, this leniency is granted.<br>The above explanations are based on Rav Kappach's edition of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah. The initial version (preserved in the standard printed texts) reads differently. Similarly, this explanation requires - as suggested by the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> - amending the standard printed text of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> to read:<br>it should be offered on the upper portion, for two were already offered on the lower portion as sin-offerings.</i><br>When does the above apply? When originally she brought all of the four of one type. If, however, they were of two types, she must bring six other doves: two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be offered as burnt-offerings, for as above, it is possible that the ones designated as her vow were not offered as burnt-offerings and she does not remember which type she specified.</i> and for her obligation, she should bring either two turtle doves or two young doves<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the previous situations, she must bring two doves to fulfill her obligation. In this instance, one of those that were offered as a burnt-offering is not acceptable, because we know for certain that the offerings originally brought were of two types and we do not know which type of dove was brought as a burnt-offering so that a sin-offering could be brought from the same type of dove. Hence she must bring an entire pair to fulfill her obligation.<br>The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's rulings based on his interpretation of the Mishnah in <i>Kinnim</i> (which is also supported by Rashi). Rav Yosef Corcus and the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explain the Rambam's understanding.</i> and offer one on the upper portion of the altar and one on the lower portion.<br>Similarly, if she gave them to the priest<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Four doves. This is speaking about a situation where the woman designated two doves as a burnt-offering for her vow and two for her obligation, one as a burnt-offering and one as a sin-offering. She forgot which type of doves she vowed, which she brought to the priest, and how she designated them.</i> and forgot what she gave him and the priest went and offered them, but was not aware where he offered all of the doves, whether he offered them all on the upper portion, all on the lower portion, or half above and half below, she should bring two turtle doves and two young doves for her vow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be offered as burnt-offerings.

The Ra'avad notes that this ruling is the subject of a difference opinion between our Sages in <i>Menachot</i> 79a.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and R. Yosef Corcus, by contrast, elaborate to show that he accepts the position of Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i>. Moreover, they cite the Rambam's ruling in Chapter 17, Halachah 18, as proof that this is the Rambam's understanding here. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> does, however, explain a way to interpret the passage according to the Ra'avad's view.</i><br>What should be done with [these accompanying offerings]?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., by definition an accompanying offering may not be sacrificed alone, only with a sacrifice, and in this instance, the sacrifice has been disqualified.</i> If there was another sacrifice that had already been slaughtered at that time,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And does not have an accompanying offering to be brought with it.</i> they should be offered together with it.

For until a sacrifice is actually disqualified, it is forbidden to destroy it. See the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Menachot</i> 7:4).</i><br>When does the above apply?

There would be no necessity to mention frankincense. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> favors the Rambam's version and explains that by mentioning frankincense, our Sages (and the Rambam) chose one of two possible answers.

Rav Ovadiah of Bartenura also follows this view. In his later years, however, the Rambam emended his text to agree with this ruling (see Rav Kapach's text). Note also Rabbi Akiva Eiger's gloss who questions the initial version of the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah.</i> - that were sacrificed for a different purpose than that for which they were originally designated are acceptable,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Hence, even if one slaughtered an animal designated as a burnt-offering for the sake of a sin-offering, one should continue performing all the subsequent tasks for the sake of a burnt-offering [the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>op. cit.</i>)]. See Halachah 3.</i> but they did not satisfy the obligation incumbent on their owner with the exception of a sin-offering and the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 3 which explains why these offerings are singled out in contrast to all others.</i> If they are offered for a different purpose, they are unacceptable. [This applies whether] one changes the purpose of the sacrifice at the time of slaughter, at the time he receives its blood, at the time he brings it to the altar, or when he casts it upon it, as we explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 13, Halachah 4.</i><br>What is meant by saying that [the owner] does not fulfill his obligation through such [a sacrifice]? For example, one slaughtered [an animal designated as] a burnt-offering as a peace-offering. It does not fulfill the obligation of the owner, neither for the burnt-offering for which he is obligated or for a sin-offering. Instead, he is obligated to bring another sacrifice. Similarly, if one slaughtered a burnt-offering brought by Reuven for the sake of Shimon, it does not fulfill the obligation either of Reuven or of Shimon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Halachah 3 which explains the derivation of this concept. The <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> questions the Rambam's equation of sacrifices offered for a different purpose than they were originally designated and those offered for the sake of a different person. There is, he explains, a fundamental difference between them. If one slaughters an animal for the sake of another person, the owner is still considered to have fulfilled his obligation. It is only when the blood is cast on the altar for the sake of another person that he is not considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Nevertheless, the Rambam's statements can be interpreted as referring to an instance when one slaughtered the animal with the intent to cast its blood on the altar for the sake of another person.</i><br>When does the above apply? When one changed the purpose of the sacrifice intentionally. If, however, one erred and had the impression that the [animal designated as] a burnt-offering was [designated as] a peace-offering and carried out all of its services for the sake of a peace-offering, the owner is considered to have fulfilled his obligation. Similarly, when one offered a sin-offering or a Paschal sacrifice for a different purpose in error, they are acceptable. For supplanting [a purpose] mistakenly is of no consequence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This also represents a change of mind for the Rambam. In his original version of his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 1:1), which is preserved in the standard printing of that text), he writes that if an intent is supplanted in error, it is considered to be supplanted. In his later years, however, the Rambam emended his text to agree with this ruling (see Rav Kapach's text).</i><br>Similarly, if one performs <i>melikah</i> on a fowl [designated as] a burnt-offering or squeezed out its blood for a different purpose, it is acceptable,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This applies even if its blood was presented on the lower portion of the altar as is the blood of a sin-offering.</i> but does not fulfill the obligation of the owner. And a sin-offering of fowl [brought for a different purpose] is unacceptable."

            "english": "All of the bones of the sacrifices that do not have marrow need not be burnt<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It is sufficient to merely discard them.</i> with the exception of the bones of the Paschal sacrifice.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Pesachim</i> 10:1-2 which explain that the bones of the Paschal sacrifice are burnt together with its meat, because according to the Rambam, the prohibition against breaking a bone from the Paschal sacrifice applies even after the mitzvah to partake of the sacrifice is concluded, it is therefore desirable to burn the bones so that they do not become a cause of transgression. The Ra'avad mentions, based on <i>Pesachim</i> 83a, it can be concluded that only bones that had marrow and which were cracked open and the marrow removed must be burnt. If they have no marrow at all, there is no need to burn even the bones of the Paschal sacrifice.<br>According to this view, the difference between the law governing the bones of the Paschal sacrifice and those of other sacrifices can be explained as follows. It is forbidden to break open the bones of the Paschal sacrifice. Therefore if the bones of a Paschal sacrifice were broken open, we can assume that this was done after the Paschal sacrifice became <i>notar</i>, for, according to many authorities, there is no prohibition against breaking the bones of a Paschal sacrifice once it has been disqualified. In such a situation, the bones are forbidden, because they served <i>notar</i> (i.e., the marrow). (See the gloss of the <i>Mishneh LiMelech</i> who notes that in <i>Hilchot Korban Pesach</i> 10:6, the Rambam writes that even in such a situation, it is forbidden to break the bones of a Paschal sacrifice, and offers a possible resolution.)<br>With regard to other sacrifices, by contrast, there is no prohibition against breaking their bones even during the time the sacrifice is acceptable. Hence we can assume that they were broken during that time and the marrow removed. Thus there is little likelihood that they served <i>notar</i> and thus became forbidden. According to this understanding, if a sacrifice was <i>notar</i>, any bone that contains marrow should be burnt. See the gloss of the Meiri to <i>Pesachim, loc. cit.</i>, who implies that the Rambam should have been more explicit in his statements.</i> We already explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:20.</i> that when a sacrifice was disqualified after it was skinned, its hide should be given to the priests<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the instance of sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity.</i> or to the owners, in the instance of sacrifices of a lesser degree of holiness. If, however, [a sacrifice] was disqualified before it was skinned, the hide is considered as the meat and it should be burnt in its entirety.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 12:2) states: \"Whenever the altar did not acquire the flesh [of a sacrifice], the owners do not acquire the hide.\"</i><br>Similarly, if a sacrifice was skinned and then it was discovered to be <i>tereifah</i> or it was disqualified because of an improper thought concerning time or place, since the sacrifice was not accepted, the hide should be burnt. [This applies] both to sacrifices of the highest degree of sanctity and to sacrifices of a lesser degree of sanctity. If, however, a sacrifice was offered for the sake of a different intent, even though the obligation of the owners was not fulfilled, since it is acceptable,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 15, Halachah 1.</i> the hide is given to the priests or the owners, as explained [above].
