There he interprets it as referring to tasks that a person would hire a servant to do rather than perform himself.<br>In his commentary on the Torah (Leviticus 23:7 , the Ramban explains that with the expression \"servile labor,\" the Torah intends to distinguish between work performed to prepare food (which he terms \"gratifying labor\") and the other forms of labor. According to the Ramban, the Torah never forbade the performance of the activities included in the labors necessary for the preparation of food. Any restrictions placed on them are Rabbinic in nature.<br>The Ramban's conception is also reflected in the statements of Rashi (<i>Beitzah</i> 12a), who interprets the Talmud's ruling (see Halachah 4), \"Since [these labors] were permitted for the sake [of preparing food], they are permitted even when [they are performed] without such an intent,\" as meaning that, according to the Torah, there is no prohibition against performing these labors at all.<br><i>Tosafot</i> (<i>Beitzah, loc. cit.</i>) differs and explains that for the performance of a labor to be allowed by the Torah, it must in some way contribute to the pleasure of the holiday. Otherwise, it is forbidden. According to this conception, all the thirty-nine labors forbidden on the Sabbath are prohibited on the holidays as well. There is, however, special dispensation to perform these labors when doing so will increase our holiday pleasure.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets the Rambam's citation of the expression \"servile labor\" as an indication that he follows the perspective shared by Rashi and the Ramban. Other authorities (e.g., the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> and the <i>Pri Chadash</i>) do not agree with the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> interpretation and explain that the Rambam favors the other position. [See also the <i>Chemdat Yisrael</i>, who explains that the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Negative Commandment 328) do not concur with the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> conception of the Rambam's position.] Note the treatment of this subject in the <i>Or Sameach</i> and in <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XI. (See also the notes on Halachah 4.)</i> with the exception of those labors necessary for [the preparation of] food, as [implied by Exodus 12:16]: \"Only that [labor] from which all souls will eat [may you perform].\""

            "english": "A person may be [punished by] lashes for performing on a holiday any labor for which he is liable on the Sabbath, if it is not necessary for the preparation of food, with the exception of the transfer of articles from one domain to another and the kindling of a fire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains the Rambam's position as follows: All the labors forbidden on the Sabbath that involve preparation of food are not prohibited on the holidays. In addition, there are two forbidden labors, kindling a flame and transferring articles, which do not necessarily involve the preparation of food. Nevertheless, since they are sometimes necessary for the preparation of food, they are permitted without any restriction.<br>Other authorities (e.g., <i>Pri Chadash, Pri Megadim</i>) interpret the Rambam's statements as meaning that even the forbidden labors involved with the preparation of food are permitted only for that purpose. If, however, one performs one of these labors for other reasons - e.g., one cooks food solely to give to animals - one is liable. Moreover, if one performs a forbidden labor that is not usually involved in the preparation of food for the purpose of preparing food, one is liable.<br>There is a third interpretation, that of the <i>Mabit</i>. (In his Responsum 124, however, he follows the second view.) According to the view he expresses in <i>Kiryat Sefer</i>, even if one performs a forbidden labor (that is not usually involved in the preparation of food) for the purpose of preparing food, one is not liable. As proof, he cites the example of making cheese, an act that the Rambam (<i>Hilchot Shabbat</i> 10:13) considers a derivative of the forbidden labor of building. Nevertheless, making cheese on a holiday is not considered a violation of a forbidden labor and is forbidden only as a <i>sh'vut</i>.</i><br>[With regard to these two forbidden labors, an exception is made.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for these two exceptions is as follows: Both are often involved in the preparation of food. Alternatively, the transfer of articles is considered \"an inferior labor\" (<i>Tosafot, Beitzah</i> 12a), and Exodus 35:3: \"Do not kindle fire... on the Sabbath day,\" is interpreted also as an exclusion, indicating that kindling fire is forbidden on the Sabbath, but not on holidays.</i>] Since it is permitted to transfer articles for the sake of [the preparation of] food [on holidays], [this activity] was permitted even when it is not necessary for [the preparation of] food. Therefore, it is permitted to transfer an infant, a Torah scroll, a key, or the like from one domain to another. Similarly, it is permitted to kindle a fire, even though it is not for the purpose of [the preparation of] food.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the notes on Halachah 1, <i>Tosafot</i> requires that the activity bring a person some pleasure. This view is also reflected in the Ra'avad's gloss.</i><br>With regard to the other forbidden labors, [the following principles apply:] Whenever the activity is necessary for [the preparation of] food - e.g., slaughter, baking, kneading, or the like - it is permitted. If it is not necessary for [the preparation of] food - e.g., writing, weaving, building, and the like - it is forbidden."

The Jew can be considered to be baking for the sake of the child. For if he did not bake for the soldiers, they would not allow him to bake for the child.<br>The <i>Rishon LeTzion</i> amplifies the difference between the two situations, explaining that because the person is not baking solely for the gentiles, the prohibition against doing so is merely Rabbinic in origin and can be waived with regard to baking for a gentile army, since the person could suffer substantial financial loss if he refused. In contrast, when inviting guests, one does so on one's own volition, with no loss involved.<br>As emphasized by <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 512:6, this leniency was granted only in this situation, because of the risk of confrontation with the military authorities.

If, by contrast, they purchased a jug [of wine] in partnership, and divided it on the holiday, [the holiday limits of] each partner's portion follow those of [its owner].<br>[What is the difference between these two laws? In the latter instance,] since the [prohibition against going beyond the holiday] limits is Rabbinic in origin,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Shabbat</i>, Chapter 27, the Rambam explains that the concept of Sabbath limits has its origins in the Torah itself. Nevertheless, according to the Torah, it is permitted to proceed twelve <i>mil</i> from one's place. The restriction of two thousand cubits is Rabbinic in origin.</i> the principle of <i>b'reirah</i> applies. Thus, it is considered as if the portion that is given to [either partner] were distinct and separated as his in the jug before the holiday; [i.e.,] it is as if [the two portions of wine] were not mixed with [the other].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Therefore, each of the partners is allowed to take his portion with him throughout his own holiday limits without worrying about his partner's circumstances.</i><br>This cannot be said with regard to an animal. Even if the portion that was given to [either partner] were considered to be separated within the animal, and it is as if it were distinct [leniency cannot be shown in this instance]. For the portion derived nurture from the portion belonging to the other colleague while the animal was alive, since all of an animal's limbs derive nurture from each other. Thus, all the animal's limbs are considered as being intermingled with the portions belonging to both partners. Therefore, [the holiday limits of the animal] are dependent on both of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This represents the opinion of Rav (<i>Beitzah</i> 37b). The Talmud, however, records the opinion of other Sages who differ and maintain that there is no difference between the laws pertaining to an animal and those pertaining to wine.<br>In the debate concerning this manner, two of the other Sages, Rav Kahana and Rav Assi, asked Rav: There is another relevant prohibition, that of muktzeh, for each of the partners diverted his attention from the portion designated for the other. Nevertheless, although the portions of meat belonging to each of the partners derived nurture from each other, none of the Sages thought of applying the prohibition of muktzeh for that reason.<br>Rav did not reply. This has led some authorities (see the gloss of Rav Moshe HaCohen, <i>Tur, Orach Chayim</i> 397) to the conclusion that Rav conceded and retracted his position. According to these views, the meat belonging to each partner may be taken throughout his holiday limits. Others (including the Rambam) maintain that Rav's inability to reply at that time does not represent a retraction of his position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Orach Chayim</i> 397:10) follows the Rambam's ruling. Nevertheless, the <i>Be'ur Halachah</i> 397 states that if there is a necessity, it is possible to rely on the more lenient view.</i>"

Cognizant that an emotion cannot be commanded at will, our Sages required that on the holidays a person work on creating a setting that will naturally spur happiness to ensue.</i> Children should be given roasted seeds, nuts, and sweets. For women, one should buy attractive clothes and jewelry according to one's financial capacity. Men should eat meat and drink wine, for there is no happiness without partaking of meat,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries have raised questions on the Rambam's statements, based on <i>Pesachim</i> 109a, which states that during the time of the Temple, \"there is no happiness without partaking of meat,\" this referring to sacrificial meat, as Deuteronomy 27:7 states, \"And you shall sacrifice peace offerings... and you shall rejoice.\" After the destruction of the Temple, \"there is no happiness without partaking of wine.\" No mention is made of the importance of eating non-sacrificial meat on the holidays.<br><i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 529:7 explains that at present there is a greater obligation to drink wine than to eat meat. Nevertheless, since most people derive pleasure from eating meat, it is proper to partake of meat on the holidays.</i>nor is there happiness without partaking of wine.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The intent is not that one's festive pleasure should be eating and drinking, as indicated by the following halachot.

Similarly, as part of his purification process a leper must shave off all the hair of his body twice (Leviticus 14:8-9; <i>Hilchot Tum'at Tzara'at</i> 11:1-2).</i> whether it arrived during the festival or before the festival, they may shave during [Chol Ha]Mo'ed, even if they had the opportunity [to shave their hair before the holiday], so that they will not delay the offering of their sacrifices.

Therefore, it is possible that he did not prepare himself for the holiday. Some also cite <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 112), which states that every person who is ritually impure must inform others about his state and make this evident from his physical appearance.

For the members of the priestly watch may not cut their hair during their week of service.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">68</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This prohibition was instituted for a reason similar to the prohibition against cutting one's hair during Chol HaMo'ed: By preventing the priests from cutting their hair during the week they served in the Temple, the Sages insured that they came to the Temple with their hair already cut (<i>Hilchot Bi'at HaMikdash</i> 1:12).</i>"

The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> 468:36, however, mentions opinions that advise leniency in a case of need.</i> During [Chol Ha]Mo'ed, by contrast, we may not place [a chicken on the eggs]. If [a chicken] leaves the eggs on which it is sitting during [Chol Ha]Mo'ed, one may return it to its place."
