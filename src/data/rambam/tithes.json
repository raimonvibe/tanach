Indeed, we find that even Sages gave their tithes to Levites (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:9). For this reason, it appears that Ezra's penalty was that if there was both a priest and a Levite present, the tithes should be given to a priest, but they could also be given to a Levite (Radbaz). Alternatively, in Ezra's generation, the tithes should be given only to the priests. Subsequently, however, when more Levites ascended and settled in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the decree was rescinded and tithes could also be given to the Levites. Nevertheless, in order not to nullify Ezra's words entirely, it was still possible to give the tithes to the priests (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). [Note, however, the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> 5:15) which indicates that the tithes were given to the priests in the generations after Ezra as well. See also <i>Hilchot Ma'aser Sheni</i> 11:14.] All agree that the Levites themselves were never required to give the tithes to the priests.<br>The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 395) asks: How was it possible for Ezra to nullify the Torah's command? For the Scriptural obligation is to give the tithes to the priests. He answers that in Ezra's time, the mitzvah to tithe was only Rabbinic in origin (see <i>Hilchot Terumot</i>, ch. 1). Hence, it was possible for him to make the priests the recipients.</i> because they did not ascend to Jerusalem with him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Ezra 8:15 which states that the descendants of the Levites were not found among the people who returned to Israel from Babylon. There were many among the Jewish people who had achieved financial security and comfortable living circumstances in Babylon and did not want to give this up to live in the Holy Land. Nevertheless, aside from the Levites, there was no distinct group that did not return to Israel in significant numbers.</i> and ordained that the first tithe should be given solely to the priests."

He also cites a version of the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ma'aserot</i> 2:10) which supports his understanding.<br>Rav Yosef Korcus offers two justifications for the Rambam's ruling. First of all, he states that the phrase \"he should not partake of them\" could be interpreted as referring to the owner of the courtyard and not to the owner of the produce. Alternatively, he explains that even if it refers to the owner of the produce, since the courtyard he brings it into is part of a permanent dwelling, he should not partake of it until he tithes it. Leniency was given to traveling salesmen (Halachah 13), because they brought the produce into the courtyard with the intent of removing it immediately. In this instance, however, the owner does not necessarily intend to remove it immediately. Why then should he not be obligated to tithe?<br>In his gloss to Chapter 5, Halachah 8, the Ra'avad notes a seeming contradiction to the Rambam's ruling here. In his gloss to that halachah, the Radbaz explains that the stringency here is to correct a misimpression that might result in the eyes of an observer. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, however, finds the Rambam's rulings difficult to reconcile and suggests that there is a printing error here.<br>Nevertheless, Rav Yosef Korcus continues, the Rambam's statements appear to be self-contradictory, because in the previous clause it appears that if one brings produce into a home after forgetting, he is not obligated to tithe it, but this clause states that if he brings it into his colleague's courtyard, he is. Seemingly, bringing it into one's own home would be a stronger factor than bringing it into a colleague's courtyard. Among the resolutions he offers is that when a person forgets and brings the produce into his own home, he is certainly acting inadvertently, without intent. If, however, he brings it into his colleague's courtyard, that could be considered as a conscious change of mind.</i>"

Thus the share to be tithed is no more than half the amount the person is taking, for he already separated the tithes for his own share.<br>In his gloss to this halachah, the Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, noting that the restrictions regarding <i>demai</i> are Rabbinic in origin and that the principle of <i>bereirah</i> can be applied in questions of Rabbinic Law. Hence, based on this principle, we could say that retroactively, it could be considered that when the person separated the tithes for his portion, he was separating the tithes for the portion that he would ultimately receive.<br>The Ra'avad explains that it is possible to say that this principle is not applied as a penalty to the person. He is penalized, because he should not have mixed his produce with that of a common person. The Radbaz amplifies this explanation, stating that by mixing his produce together with that of a common person he caused the <i>terumat ma'aser</i> that will be separated to become impure. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that initially when the separation was first made, the two batches of produce were not mixed together. Hence, it is not appropriate to say that the separation he is making now will affect the entire quantity.<br>If, however, they were full partners and did not make a division until the wine was produce, the person who is conscientious in his observance need not separate more than the tithes for his own portion. There is no need for him to be concerned about the share of the common person. For within this context, we apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> and assume that retroactively, each one is receiving his own share and hence has no responsibility for the share of his colleague.</i> Similarly, if his share was a third or a fourth, he must separate [the tithes from the produce he takes] proportionately.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If his share of the produce was one-third, he would have separated that amount of the total yield. Thus he would have to tithe two-thirds of the produce he receives.</i>"

Nevertheless, in this instance, he is not considered as buying or selling, but merely as acting as an agent for the common person.<br>In his Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Demai</i> 6:12), the Rambam elaborates in his description of this situation, explaining that we are speaking about a situation where the seller of the produce is also a <i>chavair</i> and knows that the other <i>chavair</i> has been sent by the common person to purchase produce. If the <i>chavair</i> who is the agent asks to purchase produce without qualifying his statements and explaining who he is purchasing it for, the seller must give him tithed produce. For he knows that the agent is purchasing for the common person and he does not want to cause the common person to sin.</i> If [the agent] exchanged the <i>meah</i>, he is obligated to tithe [the produce he purchased].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the seller sees that the agent uses his own money, he might suspect that he is purchasing the produce for himself and not for the common person. Hence, the seller might not tithe the produce (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>If the <i>chavair</i> was explicit and did not buy the produce without explanation, but instead said: \"This bunch of produce that I am purchasing from you is being bought for my colleague and this bunch is being bought for myself,\" he is obligated to tithe [only] the produce that he took for himself. He does not have to tithe [the bunch he purchased for his colleague].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The seller will not give him untithed produce for the common person, because he fears that he will partake of it without tithing it. He may, however, give the <i>chavair</i> untithed produce, for he knows that the <i>chavair</i> will not partake of it without tithing it (the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> If these [two batches of produce] became intermingled, even if one measure [belonging to the <i>chavair</i>] becomes mixed with 100 [belonging to the common person], he must make the separations as if the entire quantity was <i>demai</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We do not apply the principle of <i>bereirah</i> and say that the produce that the agent takes as his own was in fact the produce from which he separated the tithes.<br>All the above applies if the purchaser does not ask the seller if the produce was tithed. If, however, he asks the seller and the seller states that the produce was tithed, the agent does not have to make any separations, since the seller is also trustworthy (<i>ibid.</i>). <i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the very basis of the Rambam's assumption. For if the seller is a <i>chavair</i>, he would always tithe his produce and there would be no obligation to tithe produce purchased from him. See also the Radbaz who understands the halachah as speaking about a seller who is a common person.</i> [Only] afterwards<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., after he separated the tithes.</i> may he give the produce to the colleague who sent him to purchase them for him."
