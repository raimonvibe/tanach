To what can the matter be compared? To a person who [takes a vow] forbidding produce belonging to another person to the owner of that produce.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">According to the Rambam (based on <i>Nazir</i> 62b) , there are four different rulings with regard to vows or oaths a servant takes:<br>a) All oaths and valuation assessments that a servant takes are nullified automatically. The rationale is that \"his body is not his property so that the oath he takes will be effective. With regard to oaths, [Numbers 30:3] states: 'forbid something upon one's soul.' [Implied is that the verse applies to] someone whose soul is his property. It excludes a servant who is someone else's property\" (<i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 12:6).<br>b) Vows other than a nazirite vow that are either aggravating or prevent the servant from working are automatically nullified. The rationale is that, with regard to an oath, Leviticus 5:4 states: \"Whether he will do harm or do good.\" Implied is that he can take an oath - or a vow, because an association is established between vows and oaths - only when he has the choice of either doing good or doing harm to himself. This does not apply to these oaths. Since they harm his master, he has no right to take them.<br>c) Nazirite vows are not automatically nullified, because the association with vows does not apply with regard to them. Nevertheless, since the servant belongs to his master, the master has the right to nullify his vow.<br>d) Vows other than a nazirite vow that are neither aggravating nor prevent the servant from working must be fulfilled. The rationale is that in contrast to an oath in which the prohibition is incumbent on the servant (the <i>gavra</i>), for a vow, the prohibition falls upon the object (the <i>cheftza</i>). Since there is no harm to the master involved, such vows can take effect.</i><br>If, however, a vow does not involve personal aggravation and it is not a matter which holds back work, [the master] cannot compel him [not to observe it].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the master does not suffer any loss, there is no reason that the vow should not take effect.</i><br>If a servant took a nazirite vow and his master told him: \"It is nullified for you,\" [when] he receives his freedom,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When a master desires to nullify a vow taken by his servant, he must physically compel him to break it, as mentioned above. If he does not do so, but instead, verbally nullifies it, he is indicating that he no longer considers his servant as having that status, but has freed him. See parallels in <i>Hilchot Avadim</i> 8:17.<br>Based on a different version of <i>Nazir</i> 62b, the Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and does not agree that verbally nullifying a servant's vow is an indication that he must be freed. The commentaries support the Rambam's understanding.</i> he is obligated to complete his nazirite vow.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the verbal nullification made by his master is of no consequence.</i> [The rationale is that] a servant must be compelled to nullify his vow.

She observed her vow and came to the Temple to offer her sacrifices. The School of Hillel ruled that she should remain in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and observe her vow for another seven years, for the time she observed it in the Diaspora was not counted.</i> Accordingly, when a person takes a nazirite vow in the Diaspora in the present era, we compel him to ascend to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and observe his nazirite vow there<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">67</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions what purpose will be served by ascending to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present era. We are all impure because of contact with a human corpse (or impurity that results from that) and there are no ashes from the red heifer to purify ourselves. If so, what difference is there between <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> and the Diaspora? In neither place, will one be able to complete his nazirite vow in purity. Hence, the Ra'avad concludes, it is forbidden to take a nazirite vow in the present age, whether in the Diaspora or in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>.<br>The Radbaz states that although we are ritually impure, abiding in the Diaspora increases that impurity. Hence, it is preferable for one who takes a nazirite vow to ascend to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> goes further and states that since a person can prevent himself from coming into contact with the ritual impurity associated with a corpse, there is no prohibition against taking a nazirite vow in the present age.</i> until he dies or until the Temple is built and he brings his sacrifices there at the conclusion of the span of his vow."

Thus there is a question whether <i>Mashiach</i> - who obviously will observe the Sabbath laws - can come on the Sabbath for that will require him descending from heaven and thus going beyond his Sabbath boundaries.<br>(<i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> questions the entire issue, noting that according to the Rambam, <i>Mashiach</i> will be a flesh and blood human being who will \"wage the wars of G‑d... build the Temple\" (see <i>Hilchot Melachim</i> 11:1). No where does the Rambam make mention of him descending from heaven.</i> Since the matter is an unresolved question, on the day he took the nazirite vow, the nazirite [restrictions] do not apply to him. For whenever there is a question whether the nazirite restrictions apply, we rule leniently.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Seemingly, every day, there is a question whether the <i>Mashiach</i> will come and hence, we should rule leniently every day. The Radbaz explains that since we are certain that it is possible for <i>Mashiach</i> to come that day, he must observe the nazirite restrictions. For if <i>Mashiach</i> would actually come that day, retroactively the vow he took would take effect.</i> On the following Sabbath, although the above question still remains, it does not eliminate the nazirite vow that has taken effect concerning him."

In this instance, since he was not a nazirite previously, there is no difficulty with his entry. Hence he is not liable for remaining (<i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i>).

If not, the positive commandment supercedes the negative commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">69</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And hence, the nazirite should shave his hair.</i><br>Nevertheless, when a nazirite shaves his hair during the midst of his nazirite vow, he violates both a negative commandment and a positive commandment, as [Numbers 6:5] states: \"[His hair] is holy. He shall let the mane of the hair of his head grow.\" And [the observance of] a positive commandment does not supercede a negative commandment that [is reinforced by] a positive commandment. Why then does the positive commandment of shaving the blemish supercede his nazirite vow? Because the nazirite has already become impure because of the <i>tzara'at</i> and the days when he is defined as impure are not counted [towards the fulfillment of his vow], as we explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">70</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Halachah 9.</i> [Hence,] his [hair] is not holy during these days. Thus the positive commandment [mentioned above] is withdrawn and only the negative commandment [Leviticus, <i>loc. cit.</i>]: \"A razor shall not pass over his head\" alone remains incumbent upon him. Therefore the positive commandment of shaving [because of the <i>tzara'at</i>] can come and supercede it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">71</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad accepts the Rambam's ruling, but gives a different rationale: The commandments associated with the nazirite vow are considered as insubstantial, because the nazirite could appeal to have his nazirite vow absolved. Although the rationale given by the Ra'avad is mentioned in <i>Yevamot</i> 5a, the Rambam favors the reason he gave, for there are some nazirites who do not have the option of absolving their nazirite vows (see Chapter 3, Halachah 14).</i>"

Neither of these shavings can be considered as the same shaving as the one performed by a nazirite. The rationale is that the first shaving of the purification from <i>tzara'at</i> is for a different purpose than the shaving performed by a nazirite. For the intent of the shaving of a nazirite is to remove hair, while the intent of the first shaving performed by a person afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> is to allow hair to grow (<i>Nazir</i> 60b, Radbaz). Similarly, the second shaving associated with <i>tzara'at</i> is not analogous to the shaving associated with the nazirite vow, for the shaving of a <i>metzora</i> is performed before the sprinkling of the blood and the shaving of a nazirite afterwards.</i><br>When it is questionable whether a person was afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> [and thus became a <i>metzora</i>], the shaving [associated with emerging from] <i>tzara'at</i> does not supercede his nazirite vow. <sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Which involves a prohibition against shaving. As stated in Chapter 7, Halachah 15, ordinarily, \"When a nazirite contracts <i>tzara'at</i> and becomes healed in the midst of the days of his nazirite vow, he should shave all of his hair. The rationale is that] by shaving, he fulfills a positive commandment. [And] when there is [a conflict between] a positive commandment and a negative commandment... the positive commandment supercedes the negative commandment.\" There is also a positive commandment for a nazirite to grow his hair long and a negative commandment does not override a negative commandment and a positive commandment. Nevertheless, when a nazirite contracts <i>tzara'at</i>, that there is no positive commandment involved in growing his hair. Since it is possible that this is not the situation prevailing in this instance, he should not shave (Radbaz).</i> Therefore [the following rules apply] if a person took a nazirite vow for a year and throughout this year, there was a question whether he had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> and a question whether he had contracted ritual impurity through contact with a human corpse<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, it is questionable whether he is required to shave to perform a shaving to emerge from ritual impurity (as explained at the beginning of Chapter 6) or not.</i> or there was a question whether he had been afflicted with <i>tzara'at</i> and at the end of the year, a question arose whether he had contracted ritual impurity. He should count seven days, have [the ashes of the Red Heifer] sprinkled [upon him] on the third and seventh days,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A person who seeks to emerge from the impurity associated from the state of ritual impurity associated with contact with a human corpse must have the ashes of a Red Heifer sprinkled upon him on the third and seventh days after he became ritually impure. He must also immerse himself in a <i>mikveh</i> (<i>Hilchot Parah Adumah</i> 11:1).</i> but he should not shave [his hair] on the seventh day.
