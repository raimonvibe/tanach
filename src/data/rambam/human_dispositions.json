            "english": "Each and every man possesses many character traits. Each trait is very different and distant from the others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Many commentaries assume that the Rambam is stating simply that there are many personality types, which he proceeds to describe: e.g., the angry man, the calm man, etc. They quote various sources in support of this viewpoint, among them <i>Berachot</i> 58a: \"Whoever sees a multitude of Jews recites the blessing: 'Blessed is...the wise who knows the hidden secrets,' because just as their natures are not similar, neither are their faces.\"<br>However, by stating that the many character traits are possessed by \"each and every man,\" it is possible that Rambam is implying more than that there are people with different traits. Though in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (The Guide to the Perplexed) 2:40 the Rambam himself elaborates upon that idea, it can be said that here his intent is different. He is emphasizing the degree to which each individual's personality is a combination of different traits, which may be unrelated and even distant from each other. Anger, generosity, and modesty, for example, can be found together in the same person, much in the same way that tenants of all sorts - unrelated to each other - can be housed in a common building.<br>To illustrate these traits, the Rambam employs concrete examples of extreme personalities, so that the contrasts can be appreciated more easily.</i><br>One type of man is wrathful; he is constantly angry. [In contrast,] there is the calm individual who is never moved to anger,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Obviously, anger or passivity are not these individuals' only traits. Surely, they share the full spectrum of human emotions. However, in these individuals, these traits are most prominent.<br>See Halachah 2:3 for a further discussion of anger.</i> or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">or, if at all, he will be slightly angry, [perhaps once] during a period of several years.</i><br>There is the prideful man and the one who is exceptionally humble.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 2, Halachah 3, also deals at length with the contrasts between pride and humility.</i> There is the man ruled by his appetites - he will never be satisfied from pursuing his desires,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kohelet Rabbah</i> 1:34 states: \"No person will die having accomplished [even] half of what he desires.\" This statement is difficult to comprehend since there appear to be many successful individuals who achieve their desires. Nevertheless, their accomplishments do not necessitate that their desires will be satisfied. As the <i>Midrash</i> continues: \"A person who possesses 100 silver pieces desires 200. One who possesses 200 desires 400.\"<br>Desire itself is never satisfied. Instead, it puts the person on a constantly moving treadmill, with ever-increasing aims. As soon as one reaches one goal, he instinctively begins the pursuit of another.</i> and [conversely,] the very pure of heart, who does not desire even the little that the body needs.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This pair of contrasting personality types deal with a person's appetites which can be satisfied by sensual experience. For example, gluttony is stimulated and satisfied by taste. In contrast, the traits mentioned below - the desire for money or the lack of desire for it - do not involve the senses.</i><br>There is the greedy man, who cannot be satisfied<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, \"whose soul is not satisfied.\" Perhaps the Rambam uses \"soul,\" both here and with regard to the man ruled by his sensual appetites, because it is the desire that characterizes the man, not the performance of an action as such. A man may never indulge his passion for food, or actually amass money and yet, be gluttonous or greedy. Though, in practice, his ability to gratify his ambitions may be limited by external factors, the desires of his soul are, nonetheless, unlimited.</i> with all the money in the world, as [Ecclesiastes 5:9] states: \"A lover of money never has his fill of money.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the Rambam describes an example where the desire for money becomes a goal in itself. In contrast, a man who gathers money so that he can buy things or achieve power is not interested in money per se. Although he may be faulted for different reasons, he is not greedy for money. On the other hand, for the \"lover of money,\" money itself becomes his raison d'etre.</i> [In contrast,] there is the man who puts a check on himself;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">literally, he \"cuts himself short.\" II Kings 19:26 employs a similar usage of the root <i>ketzar</i>: \"And the inhabitants are broken, with shortened (i.e., weakened or useless) arms.\"</i> he is satisfied with even a little, which is not enough for his needs, and he does not bother to pursue and attain what he lacks.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to a lazy person, who will not bestir himself even for that which is necessary. In Chapter 2, Halachah 7, this type is described clearly as: \"lazy and an idler.\" This is the description, too, in the Rambam's Introduction to <i>Avot - Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</i><br>There is [the miser,]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In contrast to the \"lover of money\" mentioned above, the miser is not as bent on acquiring new wealth as much as hoarding the money and possessions he has.<br>who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. - The terminology the Rambam uses emphasizes the miser's need to be close to his money and possessions. Similar, but not exactly correspondent, expressions are found in the Bible (Proverbs 13:11 and the Talmud (<i>Bava Kama</i> 80a).</i> who torments himself with hunger, gathering [his possessions] close to himself. Whenever he spends a penny of his own, he does so with great pain. [Conversely,] there is [the spendthrift,] who consciously wastes his entire fortune.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chullin</i> 84b gives examples of such behavior: wearing linen clothing, using glass utensils, and hiring workers without supervising them.</i><br>All other traits follow the same pattern [of contrast]. For example: the overly elated and the depressed;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is not referring to an average optimist and a pessimist. Rather, he describes personalities who do not have a grip on reality. <i>onain</i> is the term used for the bereaved who has not yet buried his dead. <i>mehulal</i>, the other extreme, is used by Jeremiah 51:7 to refer to a state of intoxication and delirious drunkenness.</i> the stingy and the freehanded;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation of <i>shua</i> is clearly evident from <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 7:11. It follows that <i>chili</i> represents the opposite extreme. (See also Ibn Ezra, Isaiah 32:5.)<br>The difference between this pair of traits and the miser-spendthrift pair mentioned above is that the latter refers to a person's conduct toward himself, while the former refers to his conduct with regard to others. The stingy man, unlike the miser, may spend money for his own needs, but is tightfisted when others are concerned. By the same token, a freehanded man need not necessarily indulge himself, though he is generous when giving charity. Though this may sound praiseworthy, when taken to extremes it can also prove dangerous, because a person may hurt himself in the process of giving excessively to another. (See <i>Lechem Mishneh</i>.)</i> the cruel and the softhearted; the coward and the rash. and the like.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find a longer treatment of personal characteristics in the Rambam's <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4.</i>"

            "english": "Between each trait and the [contrasting] trait at the other extreme, there are intermediate points, each distant from the other.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> understands this as follows: Let us imagine a line drawn from one extreme to another - between the stingy and the freehanded, for example. All who are neither stingy nor freehanded stand between them. They are all intermediate, whether they tend towards stinginess or freehandedness. Each point along this imaginary line stands apart - \"is distant\" - from the others on that line. In a diagram, this idea might be depicted as follows:<br>X-----*-------*------*-------*----------*---------*X<br>Stingy intermediate points freehanded.<br>However, it is highly unlikely that all the Rambam wishes to teach us is that there are many intermediate points of temperament between the extremes. After all, that is self-evident. Furthermore, in each set of associated temperaments - for example, stinginess and freehandedness - only three points on the line are of importance to the Rambam in clarifying his view of personality development: the two extremes and the midpoint. Why should he mention all the other intermediate possibilities?<br>Thus, it appears that the Rambam is telling us that there is a midpoint temperament between each pair of contrasting extremes. Given the entire range of human temperaments, there are a number of midpoints which are not necessarily related to each other. For example, the midpoint for generosity may be very different from the midpoint for humility. Thus, in Halachah 1, the Rambam stated that our personality traits are \"different and distant;\" in this halachah, he makes a parallel statement about the midpoints.</i><br>With regard to all the traits: a man has some from the beginning of his conception,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., the Rambam distinguishes between genetic traits and those that are acquired.</i> in accordance with his bodily nature.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, we see an interrelation between body and soul. Certain temperaments are produced by or relate to particular physical characteristics.<br>[In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam states: \"From the outset of a person's [life], he has neither virtues nor vices....\" However, there is not necessarily a contradiction between <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> and this halachah. The possession of certain character traits does not determine whether one will use them for a vice or a virtue.]</i> Some are appropriate to a person's nature and will [therefore] be acquired more easily than other traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., these traits are not transferred genetically. However, a person is born with a tendency towards them.<br>In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam elaborates on this issue at length. He explains that some people are born with a brain whose internal chemistry is prone to intellectual achievement. However, if this person does not develop this tendency, he will not automatically become a thinker.<br>Similarly, others have leanings towards courage or cowardice. Nevertheless, these are merely tendencies, and they will not manifest themselves unless consciously developed. Also, these tendencies are, at all times, subject to man's control. We are granted free will, and choose our course of behavior.</i> Some traits he does not have from birth. He may have learned them from others,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam writes: \"From his youth, one becomes accustomed to acting in accordance with the accepted behavior of one's family and locale.\" In these few words, the Rambam includes all the people who might influence a person's character development: his parents, siblings, teachers, peers, and others. Also, note Chapter 6, Halachah 1.</i> or turned to them on his own.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are two ways of acquiring such traits</i> This may have come as a result of his own thoughts,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., an intuitive realization of the correctness of a certain course of behavior stemming from one's own creative thought.</i> or because he heard that this was a proper trait for him, which he ought to attain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., through study a person understands the value of a certain character trait and sets out to acquire it.</i> [Therefore,] he accustomed himself to it until it became a part of himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Unlike the inborn or easily acquired traits, these qualities must first be accepted intellectually. Then, through habitual actions, they become part of the personality. (See Halachah 7 for a detailed explanation of such a process of behavioral modification.)</i>"

            "english": "The straight path:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is also used in <i>Avot</i> 2:1. In his commentary on that Mishnah, the Rambam cites his explanation of the middle path in the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>.</i> This [involves discovering] the midpoint temperament of each and every trait that man possesses [within his personality.]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., a path develops out of a series of midpoints.</i> This refers to the trait which is equidistant from either of the extremes, without being close to either of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These statements echo the opening remarks of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>:<br>The good acts are those balanced ones midway between two extremes. Both of the extremes are bad - one reflects excess and the other, want. The virtues [good traits] are temperaments and habits which are midway between these two bad tendencies.<br>These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits.<br>Despite the similarity between the Rambam's statements here and those quoted, there is a slight difference. Here, the Rambam focuses on good traits, while in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, he emphasizes good actions.</i><br>Therefore, the early Sages instructed a man to evaluate his traits,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam appears to be referring to <i>Sotah</i> 5b: \"Whoever evaluates his paths in this world will merit and witness God's salvation.\"</i> to calculate them and to direct them along the middle path,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At the conclusion of Chapter 4 of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the Rambam writes:<br>When a man weighs his actions constantly and directs them towards their midpoints, he will be on the most elevated human plane possible. He will thereby approach God and grasp His will. This is the most perfect path in the service of God.<br>Constant introspection is a necessary element in any program of personal and spiritual growth. Even when a person has the highest goals, unless he frequently looks himself squarely in the mirror and examines his behavior, he may make gross errors.</i> so that he will be sound {of body}.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We have enclosed the words \"of body\" with brackets because they are not found in authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> and are problematic. Though a properly balanced temperament may also lead to physical health, this does not appear to be the Rambam's intent.<br>If the Hebrew <i>bigufo</i> is omitted as suggested, the meaning of <i>shaleim</i> would be altered from \"sound\" to \"complete\" or \"perfect.\"</i><br>For example: he should not be wrathful, easily angered; nor be like the dead, without feeling, rather he should [adopt] an intermediate course; i.e., he should display anger<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Our translation is based on Chapter 2, Halachah 3. (Note also the commentary of the <i>Knesset HaGedolah</i>.)</i> only when the matter is serious enough to warrant it,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam appears to be referring to matters which evoke personal feelings. Nevertheless, the <i>Misrat Moshe</i> interprets this passage as referring to an instance in which Torah law would require a display of anger - e.g., a colleague's transgression of Torah law.</i> in order to prevent the matter from recurring. Similarly, he should not desire<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to physical desire.</i> anything other than that which the body needs and cannot exist without, as [Proverbs 13:25] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam quotes supporting verses for only two of the \"intermediate traits;\" perhaps, because his description of the middle-of-the-road position for these traits might appear to veer toward one extreme. We might expect the intermediate point between gluttony and its opposite extreme to be eating to one's satisfaction. However, here we are told that we should desire only what is sufficient in order to exist.<br>However, the Rambam is not telling us to deny ourselves satisfaction. Deuteronomy 8:10 teaches: \"You shall eat and be satisfied, and bless God, your Lord.\" Based on that verse, <i>Berachot</i> 48b explains that we are obligated to recite grace only when we feel physically satisfied. (The Rambam quotes this concept in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 1:1.) In Chapter 3, Halachah 1, and in <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, he elaborates on the negative aspects of asceticism.<br>Thus, his intent cannot be that we deny our desires, but rather that we school ourselves to desire and feel satisfied with what we need, without excess. This is a dominant theme in the sections on diet in Chapter 4, and those describing the conduct of a Torah sage in Chapter 5.</i> \"The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse continues: \"But the belly of the wicked will want.\" The commentaries note that the contrast between the two does not center on the quantity of food they eat, but on the attitude with which they eat it. Because the righteous are not given over to pursuit of gratification, they can be satisfied. Conversely, it is the gluttony of the wicked which actually causes their want.<br>Note also the Midrashic interpretations of this verse:<br>\"The righteous...\" This refers to Eliezer, who said to Rebecca: \"Let me sip a little water\" (Genesis 24:17) - a single sip.<br>\"And the belly of the wicked will want.\" This refers to Esau, who said to Jacob: \"Stuff me...\" (Genesis 25:30). Rabbi Yitzchak ben Zeira said: he opened his mouth agape like a camel and said: \"I will open my mouth and you put it in\" (<i>Tanchumah; Pinchas</i> 13; <i>BaMidbar Rabbah</i> 21:18).</i><br>Also, he shall not labor in his business except to gain what he needs for immediate use, as [Psalms 37:16] states:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here again, the Rambam quotes a Biblical verse, because his definition of an intermediate path may seem extreme. The verse also clarifies that the Rambam is not denigrating the idea of work, but excessive preoccupation with one's profession as a means of acquiring possessions.<br>It is highly unlikely that the Rambam would criticize work per se. Note Proverbs 6:6: \"Sluggard, go to the ant, see its ways and become wise;\" and <i>Berachot</i> 8a:<br>He who enjoys the toil of his hands is greater than one who fears God..., as it is stated: \"If you eat of the work of you hands, you are fortunate and will possess the good\" (Psalms 128:2).<br>\"You are fortunate\" - in this life, and \"will possess the good\" - in the world to come.<br>The Rambam, himself, quotes the latter passage in <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> 3:11. Thus, the Rambam is not criticizing a person for working hard, but rather teaching us that work and its profits should not be our greatest priorities.</i> \"A little is good for the righteous man.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse in its entirety expresses a contrast: \"A little is better for the righteous man than the great wealth that many [of the] wicked possess.\" Note the commentary of ibn Ezra: \"The righteous man will be happier with his small lot than the wicked with their great wealth.\"</i><br>He should not be overly stingy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The printed editions of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> have <i>yikfotz</i> (close his hand). However, most manuscripts use the term: <i>yikabetz</i> (gather).<br><i>Yikfotz</i> recalls Deuteronomy 15:7: \"Do not close your hand from your needy brother.\" Thus, the contrasting extreme would be freehandedness. <i>Yikabetz</i>, like <i>vikubatz</i> in Halachah 1, reflects miserly behavior, the opposite of which is being a spendthrift. The variant texts might reflect a difference of opinion as to which opposing extremes the Rambam had in mind.</i> nor spread his money about, but he should give charity according to his capacity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 8:12-13, which places restrictions on the extent of one's generosity.</i> and lend to the needy as is fitting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Lending is also a form of charity. In <i>Hilchot Matnot Ani'im</i> 10:7, the Rambam lists eight degrees of charity.

Rather, he should be quietly happy at all times,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">his joy should be a composed sense of satisfaction.<br>[In this context, see the Ramah's conclusion of his notes to <i>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim</i> (697:1) in which he quotes Proverbs 15:15: \"A good-hearted person is always celebrating.\"]</i> with a friendly countenance.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 1:14, the Rambam defines \"a friendly countenance\" as \"a spirit of will and gentility.\"</i> The same applies with regard to his other traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam mentions many other \"intermediate traits.\" Among them:<br>Courage is the midpoint between arrogance and fear.

(See Chapter 2, Halachah 2.) He continues:<br>Therefore, the pious did not allow themselves to fix their traits at the midpoint, but would bend slightly to the side of excess or want as a hedge and a guard.<br>He goes on to explain that, even for the pious, these extremes are not ends in themselves, but means to help them overcome natural tendencies. Thus, both the pious and a person of underdeveloped character may act in an extreme manner. However, the difference between them is that the behavior of the pious is carefully calculated with the intent of refining his personality, while the underdeveloped person does so without thought, as a natural response to his whims and fancies.</i><br>What is implied?<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., how is this concept exemplified?</i> One who shuns pride<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At first glance, the choice of pride as an example is rather problematic, because in Chapter 2, Halachah 3, the Rambam states:<br>There are traits for which it is forbidden for a person to follow an intermediate path.... Such a trait is pride...The proper path is not that a person should merely be humble, but rather hold himself very lowly...Therefore, our Sages commanded: \"Be very, very humble of spirit.\"<br>It is possible to explain that because of the negative aspects of the quality of pride, the middle path that one should follow in regard to it does not resemble the middle paths of the other traits and may appear as an extreme. Pride represents one extreme, its converse being absolute lack of concern for self to the extent that one walks around in rags. Between these extremes are a number of intermediate points: modesty - which might normally be considered as the intermediate level; humility - which the Rambam considers as the true middle path; and extreme humility - which is pious behavior (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>). See also the commentary on the halachah cited above.<br>Possibly, it is the exaggerated contrasts in this set of traits that make it the most fitting example to demonstrate the principle of the middle path that the Rambam espouses. These gross differences allow for the possibility of clear distinctions.</i> and turns to the other extreme<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> emphasizes that one need not actually adopt the other extreme, but rather, he should tend his behavior in that direction.</i> and carries himself lowly is called pious. This is the quality of piety.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">which represents a deviation from the mean.</i> However, if he separates himself [from pride] only to the extent that he reaches the mean and displays humility, he is called wise. This is the quality of wisdom.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary on <i>Avot</i> 5:6, the Rambam contrasts the wise and the pious:<br>A boor is one who lacks both intellectual and ethical development...A wise man possesses both these qualities in a complete way, as is fitting.<i>A pious man is a wise man</i> who increases his piety - i.e., his emotional development - until he tends toward one extreme, as explained in Chapter 4 [of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>], and his deeds exceed his wisdom.<br>Thus, the wise man is one whose ethical behavior has been developed to the point at which it reflects his intellectual sophistication. He is able to appreciate the mean of each trait and express it within the context of his daily life. The pious man also possesses this quality, but due to his desire for ultimate self-refinement, he is willing to sacrifice himself and tend slightly to the extreme in certain instances.<br>Although in this halachah, the Rambam differentiates between the middle path - the path of the wise - and \"beyond the measure of the law\" - the path of the pious, in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11 he describes how, \"according to the greatness of the Sage, should be the care he takes to go beyond the measure of the law.\" Thus, it appears that a truly wise man will ultimately seek pious ways.</i> The same applies with regard to other character traits.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., there is a mean which is the path of wisdom, and a deviation from that course with a positive intent, which is the path of piety.</i><br>The pious of the early generations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is borrowed - out of context - from the Mishnah, <i>Berachot</i> 5:1.</i> would bend their temperaments from the intermediate path towards [either of] the two extremes. For some traits they would veer towards the final extreme,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">excess (<i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, Chapter 4)</i> for others, towards the first extreme.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">lack (ibid.). Depending on the circumstances involved, deviation to either extreme can produce positive results.</i> This is referred to<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">by our Sages...</i> as [behavior] beyond the measure of the law.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">We find this expression used in a number of Talmudic passages. For example, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 30b relates that Rabbi Yishmael, Rabbi Yossi's son, was on a journey. A porter traveling the same road asked him to help lift a load of wood. Rabbi Yishmael was a distinguished scholar, and, therefore, this base task would have been demeaning for him. Nevertheless, rather than refuse the porter entirely, Rabbi Yishmael purchased his entire load from him. This was considered as behavior beyond the measure of the law.<br>See also <i>Berachot</i> 7a and 45b, <i>Bava Kama</i> 100a, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 24b. However, in these and other Talmudic passages where the term is used, the emphasis appears to be on the ethical or legal imperative involved, without stressing the aspect of character development. [Note <i>Hilchot Aveidah</i> 11:7, the <i>Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat</i> 259:3 and 263:3, and <i>Sefer Mitzvot Katan</i> (Positive Commandment 49), which mention our obligation to go beyond the measure of the law.]<br>Thus, the Rambam appears merely to be borrowing the term used by the Sages without referring to any specific instance. The path of behavior prescribed by one's intellect corresponds to law, and an intentional deviation from that course for the sake of piety is \"beyond the measure of the law.\"</i><br>We are commanded<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Sifre</i> (on Deuteronomy 13:5  states: 'You shall walk after God, your Lord' - this is a positive commandment.\" The <i>Zohar</i> (<i>Ki Tetze</i>, p. 270) also makes a similar statement. However, neither source elaborates.<br>Among the <i>Geonim</i>, the <i>Ba'al Halachot Gedolot</i> does list it as a commandment. Rav Sa'adiah Gaon does not include it as a specific commandment.<br><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) and <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (mitzvah 610) include this as one of the Torah's 613 mitzvot. However, the Rambam's inclusion of this commandment as one of the 613 mitzvot is somewhat problematic. In <i>Shoresh</i> 4 of his introduction to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he states that he does not include any \"general mitzvah\" which does not involve a specific activity in his reckoning of the 613 mitzvot. For this reason, \"Observe My statutes\" (Leviticus 19:19) or \"Be holy\" (Leviticus 19:2) are not included in the 613 mitzvot. On the surface, the command the Rambam mentions here also seems to be an all encompassing charge to develop ourselves spiritually without any specific activity.<br>Rav Avraham, the Rambam's son, was asked this question, and he explained that here the specific activity implied by this commandment is the development of our emotions and character traits. A somewhat deeper perspective can be gained from the Rambam's own description of the mitzvah. When listing the mitzvot at the beginning of these halachot, he states that the mitzvah is \"to imitate God's ways\" and in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, he defines the mitzvah as \"to imitate Him, blessed be He, according to our potential.\"<br>The implication of these statements is that man has a constant obligation to carry out all of his deeds and guide the progress of his emotional development with the intent of imitating God. (See <i>Likkutei Sichot, Tavo</i> 5748, and note the commentary on the following halachah.)</i> to walk in these intermediate paths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Despite the Rambam's praise of piety, his very description of it as \"beyond the measure of the law\" implies that, though it is desirable, it cannot be considered as obligatory.<br><b>and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: \"And you shall walk in His ways.\" -</b> The Rambam describes this mitzvah in the following halachah. Indeed, the authoritative manuscripts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> include the paragraph we have just explained as the beginning of Halachah 6. As emphasized in the introduction to this text, the Rambam has structured the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> with the intent of \"revealing all the laws to the great and to the small with regard to each and every mitzvah.\" He does not mention philosophical and ethical concepts unless they are halachot - i.e., practical directives for our behavior.<br>In this context, we can understand the structure of this chapter. The Rambam set out to describe the mitzvah of following God's ways. As stated in this halachah, he perceives this to mean developing our personalities by emulating the qualities which the Creator reveals. As he states in the following halachah, those qualities are identical with the middle path of human behavior. Therefore, in the initial halachot of this chapter, the Rambam sets out to describe the nature of human personality and the ideal temperaments - the middle path - that man should seek to achieve. Having laid down this foundation, he is able to define that mitzvah in this halachah and begin offering directives for its fulfillment in Halachah 7.<br><b>[Our Sages] taught [the following] explanation of this mitzvah -</b> The Rambam appears to be referring to the <i>Sifre, Ekev</i> 11:22, which he quotes in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (ibid.). That explanation is also paralleled in the <i>Mechiltah</i> (Exodus 14:2  and <i>Shabbat</i> 133b.<br>It must be noted that other Talmudic and Midrashic sources interpret the commandment to imitate God in a different light. Note <i>Sotah</i> 14a:<br>[Deuteronomy 13:5 states]: \"You shall walk after God, your Lord.\" Is it possible for man to walk after the Divine Presence? Has it not been stated: \"Behold, God, your Lord, is a consuming fire\" (Deuteronomy 4:24 ?Rather, [it means] one should follow the qualities of God.Just as He dresses the naked..., you, too, should dress the naked;God visited the sick...; you, too, should visit the sick;God comforted the bereaved...;you, too, should comfort the bereaved;God buried the dead...; you, too, should bury the dead.<br>In <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i>, the Rambam mentions emulating both God's deeds and His qualities. Similarly, <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i>, in its description of this mitzvah, and the <i>Kiryat Sefer</i> in his commentary - both here in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i> and also in <i>Hilchot Eivel</i> - mention both deeds and qualities.<br>There is not necessarily a contradiction between these two emphases. As mentioned above, our actions reflect our personalities. Therefore, it follows that developing our characters in the manner outlined by the Rambam in this halachah will ultimately produce the good deeds mentioned by our Sages in the passage from <i>Sotah</i>.<br>Nevertheless, deed is often not a reflection of character. A person with many severe character faults may still do good deeds. Hence, for the \"resemblance of God\" to be complete, it is not sufficient merely to perform positive deeds. Rather, a person must undergo internal change by developing his character. Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.<br><b>Just as He is called \"Gracious,\" you shall be gracious; Just as He is called \"Merciful,\" you shall be merciful; Just as He is called \"Holy,\" you shall be holy; -</b> Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is \"piety.\" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.<br><b>In a similar manner, the prophets -</b> The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.<br><b>called God by other titles: \"Slow to anger,\" \"Abundant in kindness,\" \"Righteous,\" \"Just,\" \"Perfect,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Powerful,\" and the like. -</b> In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as \"slow to anger.\" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.<br><b>[They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths. -</b> i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.<br><b>A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him - <i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br></b><br><b>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br></b><br><b>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br></b><br>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.<br>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).<br>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.<br>to the extent of his ability. - for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.<br><b>How can one train himself to follow these temperaments to the extent that they become a permanent fixture of his [personality]? -</b> Having established personality development as a mitzvah in the previous halachah, the Rambam begins his explanation of how this mitzvah is fulfilled.<br><b>He should perform - repeat - and perform a third time -</b> Thus, a person's deeds will shape his character traits.<br>In this process of personal change, the stress is on the repetition of an act, and not on its quantity or intensity. In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.<br>As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam's explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.<br>For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: \"These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,\" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.<br>Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person's behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.<br><b>which conform to -</b> reflect and are motivated by...<br><b>the standards of the middle road temperaments -</b> described in Halachot 4 and 5.<br><b>He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty. -</b> A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.<br>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.<br><b>Then, these temperaments will become a fixed part of his personality. -</b> If the miser continues to give frequently, he will find that he no longer feels like a miser, but has become liberal in heart as well as in hand.<br><b>Since the Creator -</b> The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally \"the One who forms\" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).<br>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.<br>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, Genesis 2:7.)]<br><b>is called by these terms and they make up the middle path which we are obligated to follow, this path is called \"the path of God.\" -</b> As stated in the commentary on the previous halachah, \"the path of God\" involves controlling our emotions by using our intellect, so that our behavior is, to the extent that is possible for man, an objective response to a situation. In this manner, our behavior bears a resemblance to God's transcendence of worldly matters.<br><b>This is [the heritage] which our Patriarch Abraham taught his descendants -</b> See the <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shofetim</i> 15:<br>And what are the ways of God? Righteousness and justice, as it is stated: \"And they will keep the path of God to do righteousness and justice\" (Genesis 18:19).<br><b>as [Genesis 18:19] states: \"for I have known Him so that he will command his descendants...to keep the path of God.\" -</b> Since the path of God is mentioned in the context of Abraham's service, it appears that walking in those ways is not synonymous with the performance of the 613 commandments - for they had not been given in Abraham's time. Rather, it must refer to ethics, qualities like righteousness and justice, which are mentioned in that verse.<br><b>One who follows this path brings benefit and blessing to himself, as [the above verse continues]: \"so that God will bring about for Abraham all that He promised.\" -</b> The Rambam concludes his description of the obligation to develop our characters with the assurance that, ultimately, this course of behavior will bring us benefit and blessing.</i> - and they are good and straight paths - as [Deuteronomy 28:9] states: \"And you shall walk in His ways.\""

Therefore, the Rambam focuses more on this aspect of the commandment.</i><br>Just as He is called \"Gracious,\" you shall be gracious;<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Neither the <i>Sifre</i> nor the other sources quoted above mention the trait of holiness. Rather, the third trait mentioned is \"piety.\" Perhaps, since the Rambam gave a specific definition for piety in the previous halachah within his conception of personality development, he does not mention it in the present context to prevent any possible confusion.</i><br>Just as He is called \"Merciful,\" you shall be merciful;<br>Just as He is called \"Holy,\" you shall be holy;<br>In a similar manner, the prophets<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's choice of words is somewhat surprising since many of these expressions are also found in the Torah as well as in the prophetic works. However, in the Torah these titles are mentioned by Moses or the other prophets. Perhaps this is the Rambam's intent.</i> called God by other titles: \"Slow to anger,\" \"Abundant in kindness,\" \"Righteous,\" \"Just,\" \"Perfect,\" \"Almighty,\" \"Powerful,\" and the like.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:11-12 and in detail in <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (Guide to the Perplexed), Vol. I, Chapters 53 and 54, the Rambam explains that these names are not descriptions of God, who cannot be defined by any specific quality. To do so would limit Him and detract from His infinite and transcendent state of being.<br>Rather, the use of these titles must be understood as follows: God brings about activities, which, had they been carried out by man, would have been motivated by these emotional states. For example, instead of utterly destroying the Jews after the sin of the Golden Calf, God allowed our people to continue. Were such a deed to have been performed by a human ruler, we would describe him as \"slow to anger.\" Though that term cannot serve as a description for God - for He cannot be described - the Torah and the prophets referred to Him by such terms with the following intent.</i> [They did so] to inform us that these are good and just paths.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., God acted in ways which we identify with these qualities - and the Torah and the prophets mention these actions - because these are attributes which man should strive to achieve.</i> A person is obligated to accustom himself to these paths and [to try to] resemble Him<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Likkutei Sichot</i> (ibid.) states that with the latter phrase, the Rambam is adding a new thought. As explained above, God cannot be described by any particular quality. If He manifests a quality, it is for a specific intent.<br>In <i>Moreh Nevuchim</i> (ibid., Chapter 54), the Rambam mentions that the leader of a country should act in a similar manner.<br>Sometimes he will be merciful and generous to some people - not because of his feelings and natural compassion, but because they are deserving of such treatment.<br>Sometimes he will bear a grudge, seek revenge, and rage against certain people - not out of feelings of anger... - but in order to produce positive results....<br>The ultimate ideal man can achieve is to imitate God according to his potential... i.e., to have our deeds resemble His deeds.<br>For this reason, human behavior should not be motivated by the spontaneous expression of emotion. Rather, man's emotions should arise as the result of a deliberate process of thought.<br>This reflects themes brought out in the previous halachot of this chapter: that a person must constantly evaluate and review his emotions (Halachah 4); that it is a wise man who is able to appreciate the middle path (Halachah 5).<br>This is what is meant by the imitation of God: that a person not be controlled by the unchecked expression of his emotions. Rather, he should control his feelings and, motivated by his desire to resemble God, search to find the correct and proper quality, the middle path, appropriate to the situation at hand.</i> to the extent of his ability.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for man is ultimately finite in nature, and no true resemblance to God is possible.</i>"

In his Commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Avot</i> 3:15, the Rambam writes that giving a thousand coins to one person at one time is not as effective in stimulating feelings of generosity as giving a single coin one thousand times.<br>As mentioned in Halachah 4, though the Rambam's explanations in this chapter parallel those of the fourth chapter of <i>Shemonah Perakim</i>, the texts differ in stressing actions (as the opening lines of that chapter imply), or on character development, which is the theme of our text.<br>For this reason, the two texts also perceive the process of causation differently. In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam states: \"These actions [good actions] are produced as a result of these [the good] traits,\" while here he sees the traits being produced by the actions.<br>Nevertheless, the two texts do not actually contradict each other. Both statements are true. Our deeds reflect our personalities, and they also help shape those personalities. Generally, this means that a person's behavior will reinforce and strengthen the character traits that motivated those very deeds. However, this chapter - and more particularly, this halachah - deals with a person who has made a commitment to change and refine his character. Therefore - based on his intellect and the directives of the Torah, rather than his spontaneous feelings - he chooses to perform deeds that will bring about this process of inner change.</i> - repeat - and perform a third time - the acts which conform to<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">reflect and are motivated by...</i> the standards of the middle road temperaments.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">described in Halachot 4 and 5.</i> He should do this constantly, until these acts are easy for him and do not present any difficulty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A trait possessed by a person produces activities naturally and spontaneously. However, if one has not acquired a trait as yet, certain actions will be foreign to his nature, and one must trouble himself to perform them.<br>For example, a liberal man gives charity naturally; the miser must force himself to give. The action for each is the same, but not the inner feelings.</i> Then, these temperaments will become a fixed part of his personality.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the miser continues to give frequently, he will find that he no longer feels like a miser, but has become liberal in heart as well as in hand.</i><br>Since the Creator<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam uses the term <i>yotzer</i> - literally \"the One who forms\" - (which appears only one other time in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>: <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 1:7).<br>The Rambam describes God as the Creator with reference to the Divine qualities he describes in these halachot. Before the existence of the world and man, there would be no purpose for God to reveal these qualities, for until man's creation, no one could learn from or emulate them.<br>[The word <i>yotzer</i> may also be used because of its connection to the word <i>yeitzer</i>, meaning drive or inclination. (See Rashi, Genesis 2:7.)]</i> is called by these terms and they make up the middle path which we are obligated to follow, this path is called \"the path of God.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in the commentary on the previous halachah, \"the path of God\" involves controlling our emotions by using our intellect, so that our behavior is, to the extent that is possible for man, an objective response to a situation. In this manner, our behavior bears a resemblance to God's transcendence of worldly matters.</i> This is [the heritage] which our Patriarch Abraham taught his descendants,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the <i>Midrash Tanchumah, Shofetim</i> 15:<br>And what are the ways of God? Righteousness and justice, as it is stated: \"And they will keep the path of God to do righteousness and justice\" (Genesis 18:19).</i> as [Genesis 18:19] states: \"for I have known Him so that he will command his descendants...to keep the path of God.\"<br>One<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the path of God is mentioned in the context of Abraham's service, it appears that walking in those ways is not synonymous with the performance of the 613 commandments - for they had not been given in Abraham's time.

            "english": "A person might say, \"Since envy, desire, [the pursuit] of honor, and the like, are a wrong path and drive a person from the world,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With these statements, the Rambam obviously refers to the mishnah from <i>Avot</i> which he quoted at the conclusion of the previous chapter. Having decried the traits mentioned there, he explains that his condemnation is directed against excessive materialism, but not against all involvement in worldly affairs.</i> I shall separate from them to a very great degree and move away from them to the opposite extreme.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., asceticism</i> For example, he will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor live in a pleasant home, nor wear fine clothing, but, rather, [wear] sackcloth and coarse wool and the like<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 4, the Rambam makes a similar - but more lengthy - condemnation of asceticism. There he also mentions other ascetic practices - refraining from sleep and seeking solitude in the mountains and deserts.</i> - just as the pagan priests do.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This translation follows the published texts of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> which state: <i>kohanei haovdei kochavim</i>. However, many manuscripts and early printed editions state <i>kohanei Edom</i> - \"Roman priests,\" which would seem to indicate that the Rambam had hermitlike Catholic monastic orders in mind.</i><br>This, too, is a bad path and it is forbidden to walk upon it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam explains that, at certain times, many of the pious adopted ascetic practices as a safeguard against excessive involvement in materialism. However, they never regarded such practices as a goal in their own right. Others observed their behavior and mistook asceticism for an end rather than a means to achieve the middle path.<br>From the Rambam's statements in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, it would appear that there are two drawbacks to asceticism:a) It might lead a person to poor health, illness, and a lack of strength which would prevent him from serving God as the Rambam states in Halachah 3. b) A person might err and feel that he has fulfilled his obligation to serve God through these ascetic practices. As a result, he may never feel the need to dedicate himself to the service of God as He prescribed in the Torah.<br>There is a third disadvantage that is stressed heavily by the teachings of Kabbalah and Chassidut and may be hinted at by the Rambam's statements in the following halachot.<br>The <i>Zohar</i> (Vol. II, p. 42b) states that God created the world \"in order to let Himself be known.\" Similarly, <i>Tanya</i> (Chapter 33) explains that God created the world because He desired to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds. Thus, a person who tends to otherworldliness and asceticism, defeats God's purpose in creation.</i> Whoever follows this path is called a sinner [as implied by Numbers 6:11's] statement concerning a nazarite: \"and he [the priest] shall make an atonement for him, for his having sinned regarding [his] soul.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A nazarite is forbidden to become impure through any contact with a dead body for the extent of his nazarite vow. If he contracts such impurity, he is required to bring a special sin offering. See Numbers, Chapter 6, <i>Hilchot Nezirut</i>, Chapters 6-8.</i> Our sages declared:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ta'anit</i> 11a. [Interestingly, the author of this statement, Rabbi Eliezer HaKfar, is also the author of the statement (<i>Avot</i>, <i>ibid.</i>) that \"envy, desire, and the pursuit of honor, drive a person from the world.\"]</i> If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">If the nazarite who abstained only from wine requires atonement, how much more so does one who abstains from everything.</i><br> Therefore, our Sages directed man to abstain only from those things which the Torah denies him and not to forbid himself permitted things by vows and oaths<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">One should not conclude that the Rambam completely disapproves of vows and oaths. At the conclusion of <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i> (13:23), the Rambam states: \"Whoever takes a vow in order to stabilize his temperaments and correct his deeds, is zealous and praiseworthy.\"<br>In <i>Hilchot Nedarim</i>, he gives examples of people who were excessively inclined to a particular quality who take vows to correct their faults (in a manner reminiscent of his advice in the beginning of Chapter 2 of these halachot). Rather, what the Rambam criticizes in our halachah is abstention for the sake of abstention.</i> [of abstention].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 4:12:<br>Rav Chizkiyah the priest said in the name of Rav: \"A person will ultimately be called to judgment for everything which his eye saw and which he did not taste.\"Rav Lazar was concerned because of this teaching. He saved his pennies and would [purchase] and eat from every fruit once a year.</i> Thus, our Sages stated:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Nedarim</i> 9:1</i> Are not those things which the Torah has prohibited sufficient for you that you must forbid additional things to yourself?<br>This<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam prefaces this statement with the following comment: \"Our Sages have made statements about this subject which are more marvelous than any others that I have ever seen.\"<br>This general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam also criticizes excessive fasting. He quotes the prophet, Zechariah, who questions the motives of the Jews' fasts (7:5): \"Was it for Me that you fasted?\" and exhorts them to \"Practice true justice, and show kindness and mercy every man to his brother\" as the proper service of God. To underscore this point, he concludes with the prophecy (<i>ibid.</i> 8:19) that even the public fasts will ultimately be transformed into festivals and days of rejoicing.</i> general statement also refers to those who fast constantly. They are not following a good path, [for] our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ta'anit</i> 11a</i> have forbidden a man to mortify himself by fasting.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The phrase \"to mortify himself\" is significant here. The Rambam (<i>Hilchot Ta'anit</i> 1:4; 1:9) himself mentions that the Sages commanded both the community and the individual to fast in times of distress.<br>The Rambam's statements have been questioned by the Rashba (Responsa 431 and 688) and by the <i>Lechem Mishneh</i> based on <i>Nedarim</i> 10a. However, the commentaries note that Shmuel, the author of the statement in <i>Ta'anit</i>, also states (<i>Bava Kama</i> 91a) that one may fast. Here, the Rambam's statements are directed against self- mortification and asceticism and not against fasting per se.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in <i>Hilchot Teshuvah</i>, when the Rambam describes \"the paths of Teshuvah\" (3:4), he makes no mention of fasting.</i> Of all the above, and their like, Solomon directed and said: \"Do not be overly righteous and do not be overly clever; why make yourself desolate?\" (Ecclesiastes 7:16)<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The midrashic works have not interpreted this verse in the manner suggested here. However, we find other Spanish Jewish Sages who followed this interpretation. See Duties of the Heart 3:25, Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Ecclesiastes.<br>Note that this verse uses the two terms - the righteous (<i>tzadik</i> and the wise (<i>chacham</i>) - which the Rambam has used to designate the man with a ideal traits.<br>The placement of this halachah raises questions. One might have expected it to appear in the previous chapter which deals with other excesses and deviations from the middle path. However, it is possible to explain that, in its present position, it serves as a preface to the following halachot which explain how our service of God and connection to Him can be established within the context of our material reality. Thus, when viewed as a totality, this chapter emphasizes how Judaism desires that religious fulfillment be found within the context of our day to day life, rather than in otherworldly \"spiritual\" activities.</i>."

            "english": "A person should direct his heart and the totality of his behavior to one goal,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, Chapter 5, the Rambam addresses himself to many of the concepts mentioned in this and the following halachah. He begins that chapter with the declaration:<br>A person must control all the powers of his soul with [his] intellect... and concentrate on a single goal at all times: To comprehend God, blessed be He, to the extent that man can know Him.All of his activities: what he does, the way he rests, and what he says should lead to this goal.</i> becoming aware of God, blessed be He.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Literally, the term means \"The Name,\" but obviously, it refers to the Master of The Name.</i> The [way] he rests, rises, and speaks should all be directed to this end.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In the previous Halachah, the Rambam condemned asceticism and otherworldliness. In this Halachah, he stresses the desired intent of our worldly involvement, to know God.<br>In Chapter 1, Halachah 6, the Rambam introduced a religious component into the development of an ethical personalty, pointing out that we must \"imitate\" God's qualities. In this halachah, he adds a further point. All of man's actions are to be taken in an atmosphere of God-awareness.<br>The concept of knowing God recalls the opening Halachah of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>:<br>The fundamental [principle] upon which all fundamental [principles are based] and the pillar of the wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Being.<br>In both halachot, the Rambam emphasizes how the knowledge of God is not an abstract, intellectual past-time, but rather an all- encompassing commitment, embracing every aspect of our experience. Torah living does not confine God to the synagogue or the house of study, but provides us with a means to relate to Him within every dimension of our lives (<i>Al HaTeshuvah</i>).<br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. - i.e., he should not view the acquisition of money as an end in its own right.</i><br>For example: when involved in business dealings or while working for a wage, he should not think solely of gathering money. Rather, he should do these things,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as a means...</i> so that he will be able to obtain that which the body needs<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">food, drink, a home and a wife. - However, as the Rambam continues in the following Halachah, the maintenance of physical well-being is also not an end in its own right. Rather, it is also only a means for the service of God.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam also uses the expression \"solely for pleasure,\" indicating that the Rambam does not advocate a life without physical pleasure. (Note also the passage from the Rambam's commentary on the Mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, quoted below.)<br>There is nothing wrong with enjoying food, for example, as long as one does so within the framework of maintaining health. Indeed, in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, the Rambam emphasizes how one may use pleasure to encourage himself to perform the acts necessary to maintain his health.</i> - food, drink, a home and a wife.<br>Similarly, when he eats, drinks and engages in intimate relations, he should not intend to do these things solely for pleasure to the point where he will eat and drink only that which is sweet to the palate and engage in intercourse for pleasure. Rather, he should take care to eat and drink only in order to be healthy in body and limb.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam has just laid down the principle that all of man's actions are to be carried out in a framework of awareness of God. Yet, to exemplify this principle, he speaks not of awareness of God, but of avoiding indulgence and maintaining one's health. The Rambam introduces the maintenance of health as an immediate - and intermediary - goal which will provide us with a program of concrete action.</i><br>Therefore, he should not eat all that the palate desires like a dog or a donkey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam states: \"In such an activity, a person is just like an animal. It is not an action man undertakes because he is a man, but rather, one that he undertakes because he is an animal.\"</i> Rather, he should eat what is beneficial for the body, be it bitter or sweet. Conversely, he should not eat what is harmful to the body, even though it is sweet to the palate.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam gives a full list of proper eating habits in the following chapter. Here, he cites only selected examples:</i> For example: a person with a warm constitution should not eat meat or honey, nor drink wine,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27). One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, - this is given as a remedy for a warm liver constitution (Maimonides' Medical Aphorisms).</i> as Solomon has stated in a parable: The eating of much honey is not good (Proverbs 25:27). One should drink endive juice, even though it is bitter, for then, he will be eating and drinking for medical reasons only, in order to become healthy and be whole<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.</i> - for a man cannot exist without eating and drinking.<br>Similarly, he should not have intercourse except to keep his body healthy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 4, Halachah 19, for a discussion of this matter.</i> and to preserve the [human] race.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad mentions a third reason for intercourse - granting one's wife her conjugal rights The Rambam does not mention that issue here because, in these chapters he focuses on those behaviors in which a person engages voluntarily as an expression of his personal desires. He discusses a man's conjugal obligations later in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> Therefore, he should not engage in intercourse whenever he feels desire,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See also Chapter 5, Halachah 4, which discusses the frequency of intimate relations.</i> but when he knows that he requires a seminal emission for medical reasons or in order to preserve the [human] race.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In his commentary to the mishnah, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 7:4, the Rambam writes:<br>The intent of intimate relations is the preservation of the species and not only pleasure. The aspect of pleasure was only introduced in order to arouse the creations toward that ultimate goal...The proof of this is that desire and pleasure cease after ejaculation for this was the entire goal for which our instincts were aroused. If the goal were pleasure, satisfaction would continue as long as man desired.</i>"

            "english": "A person who accustoms himself to live by [the rules of] medicine does not follow a proper path if his sole intention is that his entire body and limbs be healthy<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam puts the maintenance of health mentioned in the previous halachah into proper perspective. It is not to be pursued as a goal in its own right. Rather, it should be appreciated as merely a means to enable one to reach an awareness of God. The Rambam develops this idea at length in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> Chapter 5. There, he states:<br>A person should have the intention while eating, drinking, having intercourse, sleeping, awakening, moving, and resting, [that he does so] for the purpose of his physical health alone.His intention in [seeking] physical health should be to prepare for the soul healthy and sound vessels to acquire wisdom and intellectual and emotional advantages until he reaches the goal of [knowing God].</i> and that he have children who will do his work and toil for him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., though procreation is a valid reason for intimate relations, one's intent in procreation should not be selfish.</i> Rather, he should have the intent that his body be whole and strong, in order for his inner soul to be upright so that [it will be able] to know God.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam also elaborates on the interrelation between the attainment of physical health and spiritual achievement in the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 27.<br>Heath is necessary as part of one's process of striving to know God...</i> For it is impossible to understand and become knowledgeable in the wisdoms when one is starving or sick, or when one of his limbs pains him.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Maggid of Mezeritch would say: \"A small hole in the body creates a large hole in the soul.\"</i> [Similarly,] one should intend to have a son [with the hope that] perhaps he will be a wise and great man in Israel.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is the desired goal in procreation - to perpetuate the nation, not only physically, but also spiritually.<br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God. - In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam associates such behavior with Deuteronomy 6:5: \"Love God, your Lord, with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might.\" The course of action described enables us to dedicate every aspect of our being toward the love of God as prescribed by this verse.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He. - Perhaps, the Rambam uses this name for God to convey the concept that just as God's presence pervades all existence, our service of Him must encompass all aspects of our lives.<br>On this matter, our Sages - <i>Avot</i> 2:15</i><br>Thus, whoever walks in such a path all his days will be serving God constantly; even in the midst of his business dealings, even during intercourse for his intent in all matters is to fulfill his needs so that his body be whole to serve God.<br>Even when he sleeps, if he retires with the intention that his mind and body rest, lest he take ill and be unable to serve God because he is sick, then his sleep is service to the Omnipresent, blessed be He.<br>On this matter, our Sages have directed and said: \"And all your deeds should be for the sake of Heaven.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i> (<i>ibid.</i>), the Rambam elaborates upon this statement as follows:<br>Our Sages included this entire concept in the most succinct expression possible... When one meditates on this concise statement, one wonders how they could describe in its entirety an idea so awesome that many books were written about it without encompassing it totally. Without a doubt, [the statement] was made with Divine inspiration.<br>The commentaries note that <i>Beitzah</i> 16a stated concerning Hillel: \"All of his deeds were for the sake of Heaven,\" and associates that with the following narrative in <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 34:3.<br>Hillel bid his students farewell. They asked him where he was going He told them that he was going to perform a mitzvah. They discovered that he was going to the bathhouse and asked him to explain his previous statements. He told them: Since the human body is created in the image of God, it is a mitzvah to wash oneself.</i> This is what Solomon declared in his wisdom: \"Know Him in all your ways<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Avot D'Rabbi Natan</i> 17:7 also associates the above statement with this Biblical quote. <i>Berachot</i> 63b describes this verse as: \"A small passage upon which all the fundamentals of Torah depend.\" Note also the Rambam's comments in <i>Shemoneh Perakim</i>, <i>ibid.</i><br><i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. III, notes that the rules of Torah scholarship would have called for the quotation of the Biblical verse before the quote from our Sages. However, the Rambam chooses this sequence because it reflects a progression in the service of God.<br>\"All of your deeds should be for the Sake of Heaven\" implies that the deeds are not themselves holy, merely that they are directed toward a Godly intent. \"Know Him in all your ways\" implies that a bond with God can be established within the context of our physical activity itself.</i> and He will straighten your paths\" (Proverbs 3:6).<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Iggerot HaKodesh</i>, the Ramban interprets the state described in this clause as a natural product of the elevated rung of service mentioned in the previous clause. When a person develops an all encompassing bond with God, Divine light will illuminate all his paths.</i>"

            "english": "<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the commentary to the first chapter, in <i>Hilchot De'ot</i>, the Rambam puts a far greater stress on a person's emulation of God's \"attributes\" and less to the emulation of His deeds. Therefore, the first three chapters emphasize the importance of personality development and the methods with which we can refine our character traits. This chapter concludes the treatment of the mitzvah to emulate God and focuses on the \"good deeds\" that reflect the process of inner refinement described above.<br>In Chapter 3, the Rambam postulates that we must set two goals for our behavior:<br>a) an immediate and intermediary goal, the maintenance of physical health;<br>b) the ultimate goal, the knowledge and service of God.<br>In Chapter 4, he outlines a regimen of behavior that allows man to reach the first goal. In this chapter, he concentrates on the second and more complete purpose.</i>Just as the wise man<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This term provides the key to this chapter. Throughout the chapter, the Rambam uses the term <i>talmid chacham</i> (Torah Sage). However, he begins the chapter by using the term, <i>chacham</i> (wise man), to refer to his statements in Chapter 1, Halachot 4-5, which describe a wise man as one who constantly evaluates his behavior and follows the desired middle path.</i> is recognized through his wisdom and his temperaments and in these, he stands apart from the rest of the people, so, too, he should be recognized through his actions<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (positive mitzvah 8) describes the mitzvah of resembling God as seeking \"to emulate Him - His good deeds and the honorable attributes with which He was described.\"</i> - in his eating,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The commentaries have suggested the <i>Sifre, Zot HaBrachah</i> and <i>Derech Eretz Zuta</i>, Chapters 5 and 7 as sources for the Rambam's statements. However, neither of those sources is quoted verbatim. Rather, they serve as models which the Rambam uses as the basis for his own composition.<br>The Rambam elaborates on each of the particulars listed here in the following halachot. In regard to eating, see the second part of this halachah and Halachah 2.</i> drinking,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to drinking wine.

A Torah Sage<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the Rambam begins the chapter with the use of the term <i>chacham</i> (wise man), when he starts to speak of details, he employs the term <i>talmid chacham</i> (Torah Sage). Perhaps this implies that the peaks of character development epitomized by the <i>chacham</i> can only be achieved when one develops his wisdom in Torah study.<br><b>should not be a glutton. Rather, he should eat food which will keep his body healthy, -</b> as described in the previous chapter. Furthermore, even when eating these foods, he should not overindulge.<br><b>without overeating. -</b> In the previous chapter, Halachah 15, the Rambam warned against overeating from a health perspective. Now, he treats it as an ethical inadequacy and a departure from the desired middle path. See also Chapter 1, Halachah 4, Chapter 3, Halachah 2.<br><b>He should not seek to fill his stomach, like those who stuff themselves with food and drink until their bellies burst. -</b> The Rambam underlines the negative aspects of the tendency to overindulge and gorge oneself on food by using an extreme example. See also the Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 8, where he compares people who pursue gluttony to a slave who revels in dung.<br><b>They are alluded to by [the statement of] the prophet [Malachi 2:3]: \"I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your feasts.\" -</b> We have translated the verse in keeping with the interpretation of our Sages quoted below. However, in its original context, the verse refers to those who bring the festival offerings without proper intent.<br><b>Our Sages -</b> <i>Shabbat</i> 151b<br><b>explain: These are the people who eat and drink and make all their days like feast days. -</b> Though it is a mitzvah to celebrate the Sabbaths and festivals with feasts, here we are referring to those who feast:a) self-indulgently and without a commitment to fulfill God's will; andb) constantly and not only on select occasions.<br><b>They say, \"Eat and drink for tomorrow, we will die.\"</b> This statement is found in Isaiah 22:13. However, the Rambam is not quoting the verse as a support, he is merely borrowing the expression to exemplify an existential search for pleasure.<br><b>This is the food of the wicked. It is these tables which the verse censures, saying: \"For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room\" (Isaiah 28:8). -</b> The final word of the verse, <i>makom</i>, can also refer to God and thus, implies that God's presence is also lacking. Eating for the sake of indulgence is the direct opposite of the approach of \"Knowing God in all your ways\" described previously.<br><i>Avot</i> 3:3 also quotes this verse and the Rambam alludes to that mishnah in the following halachah.<br>In contrast, a wise man eats only one dish or two, eating only enough to sustain him. That is sufficient for him. - As a source for eating two dishes, the commentaries have suggested <i>Derech Eretz Rabbah</i>, Chapter 7:<br>It happened that Rabbi Akiva served a meal to his students. [The servants] brought two dishes before them... they ate and were satisfied.<br>As a source for eating one dish, they point to (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 94b):<br>\"And may the name of the righteous be blessed (Proverbs 3:33)\" - this refers to Hezekiah, king of Judah, who ate [only] a <i>litra</i> of greens for a meal.<br>These sources notwithstanding, it appears that the Rambam is merely stating that a Sage should confine himself to simple and modest fare; he may not have had a specific source in mind.<br><b>This is alluded to by Solomon's statement: \"The righteous man eats to satisfy his soul\" (Proverbs 13:25). -</b> Note the Rambam's use of this verse in Chapter 1, Halachah 4.</i> should not be a glutton. Rather, he should eat food which will keep his body healthy, without overeating. He should not seek to fill his stomach, like those who stuff themselves with food and drink until their bellies burst. They are alluded to by [the statement of] the prophet [Malachi 2:3]: \"I will spread dung on your faces, the dung of your feasts.\" Our Sages explain: These are the people who eat and drink and make all their days like feast days.

            "english": "When the wise man eats the little which is fitting for him, he should eat it only in his own home, at his table.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The previous halachah discussed the quantity of food and the attitude with which it was to be eaten. The present halachah concerns itself with the place and the company in which the wise should eat. It revolves around the principle that a person should be modest while eating and refrain from doing so in public. (See the Guide to the Perplexed, ibid.)</i> He should not eat in a store<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kol Ya'akov</i> notes that this store may even be one specifically designated for eating, e.g., a restaurant, coffee-shop, or the like. Indeed, we find the Hebrew, <i>chanut</i>, used to refer to a place of eating in <i>Bava Metzia</i> 83b.</i> or in the marketplace,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though the Jerusalem Talmud, <i>Ma'aserot</i> 3:2 mentions this prohibition in reference to a Torah Sage, the Babylonian Talmud, <i>Kiddushin</i> 40b condemns even a common person for such behavior, stating: \"Whoever eats in the marketplace is like a dog.\" The passage in <i>Kiddushin</i> continues to explain that such a person is unacceptable as a witness and the Rambam quotes that law (<i>Hilchot Edut</i> 11:5).<br>The commentaries have attempted to resolve this difficulty in different ways: For example <i>Tosafot, Kiddushin</i> (ibid.) explains that a common person is condemned only if he eats a full meal in the market place, while a wise man should not eat anything at all in public. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> (<i>Hilchot Edut</i>) differentiates between eating in a crowded place - which is forbidden for everyone - and eating in a quiet corner - which is deemed improper only for a Sage. The <i>Bach</i> (<i>Choshen Mishpat</i> 34) explains that a common person is censored only for eating while walking through the market place, while the wise man should not eat in public even while standing in one place.<br>Nevertheless, it must be noted that in this halachah, the Rambam uses the expression <i>chacham</i> (a wise man), his ideal for a person with a developed personality, and not <i>talmid chacham</i> (a Torah Sage). Apparently, he does not differentiate between a Torah Sage and a common person in this matter and requires a refined, highly developed standard in meeting our physical needs from everyone.</i> unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">unless there is a very pressing need, lest he be viewed without respect by others.</i><br> He should not eat together with the unlearned,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Sanhedrin</i> 52b states that, at the outset, a common person will consider a Torah Sage to be like a vessel of gold. However, if the Sage derives benefit from the common person, he will come to regard the Sage like an earthenware shard.<br>Note <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:11, where the Rambam equates the dining of a learned and pious man together with the unlearned with the desecration of the Name of God. See also <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> (25:4) where he rules that communal leaders and judges should not eat and drink with the common people.</i> nor at those tables that are \"filled with vomit and excrement.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This expression is obviously a reference to <i>Avot</i> 3:3:<br>[When] three eat at one table and do not speak words of Torah there, it is as if they eat from sacrifices to the dead [i.e., idols] as [Isaiah 28:8] states: \"For all tables are full of vomit and excrement; there is no room.\"<br>In his commentary to this mishnah, the Rambam writes:<br>Previously, the verse dealt with eating and drinking while forsaking the Torah and those who study it. Therefore, all of these tables are considered as if excrement and filth; i.e., the foods of idol worship, are eaten upon them.<br>Furthermore,...</i> He<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">the wise man</i> should not eat frequently in other places,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">outside his own home; i.e., the wise man, even when he eats in a private home and in the proper company, should limit the number of homes that he frequents (<i>Pesachim</i> 49a).</i> even in the company of wise men, nor should he eat where there is a large gathering.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reason for these restrictions is, as the Rambam expresses in the Guide to the Perplexed (ibid.), a basic desire for a person, particularly when he relates to others, to emphasize the refined and developed aspects of his being and not those which he shares with other animals. Therefore, even when there is no danger of subjecting himself to undesirable influences or disgracing the Torah with which he is identified, he should refrain from performing a physical activity like eating in the presence of others.</i><br>It is not fitting for him to eat at another person's [table] except at a feast associated with a mitzvah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chullin</i> 95b states that Rav would not partake of a meal in public unless it was associated with a mitzvah.</i> e.g., a betrothal<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This decision is not accepted by all authorities. Some do not consider such a betrothal feast as \"associated with a mitzvah.\"<br><i>Erusin</i> translated as \"betrothal,\" refers to the first stage of the marriage process, i.e., giving the woman the wedding ring. In Talmudic and post-Talmudic times, this ceremony was carried out before the actual wedding (<i>nisuin</i>). At present, we perform the two stages of the wedding, <i>erusin</i> and <i>nisuin</i> together. Thus, reference to what we term engagement as <i>erusin</i> is technically a misnomer.</i> or wedding feast<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and then, [only] when a scholar is marrying the daughter of a scholar. - <i>Pesachim</i> 49a mentions that weddings between scholars and common people are undesirable and should not be attended by a Torah Sage (<i>Avodat HaMelech</i>).

The measure given here is the one allotted to Torah Sages.</i> from Sabbath evening to Sabbath evening,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ketubot</i> (ibid.) states that Psalms 1:3: \"It brings forth its fruit in its season\" applies to such a person.<br>[The commentaries note the continuation of the verse, \"Its leaves will not wither\", and interpret it as implying that the draining of physical energy caused by intimate relations which the Rambam described in Chapter 4, Halachah 21, will not occur when a person follows this schedule.]<br><i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> (attributed to the Ramban) emphasizes that on the Sabbath, a person is granted a greater spiritual potential which enables him to maintain his bond with God even when involved in physical activities.</i> if he has the physical stamina.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Ishut</i>, Chapter 14, where the Rambam prescribes criteria for the frequency of intimate relations that are coordinated with a person's physical stamina.<br>When he speaks - The Rambam quotes this euphemism for intimate relations from <i>Nedarim</i> 20b.</i><br>When he speaks with her, he should not do so at the beginning of the night, when he is sated and his belly [is] full, nor at the end of the night, when he is hungry; rather, in the middle of the night, when his food has been digested.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note Chapter 4, Halachah 19. <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> explains that both during the time food is being digested and when a person is hungry, his emotional balance is somewhat disturbed and it is difficult for him to develop the proper attitude and spiritual awareness necessary to make intimate relations a Godly act.<br><i>Nedarim</i> 20b emphasizes that the midnight hour also allows a person to rest from all his worldly involvement. The quiet of the hour prevents him from being disturbed by other thoughts and he is able to concentrate on his wife alone.<br>Despite the advantages of having relations at midnight, many contemporary authorities suggest that a couple not hold to this as a binding rule. If a couple have already begun thinking of sex, they should not be forced to wait until midnight to fulfill their desires.<br>He should not be excessively lightheaded, - Previously (Chapter 2, Halachah 7), the Rambam cited a mishnah (<i>Avot</i> 3:16) which links lightheadedness and immorality.</i><br>He should not be excessively lightheaded, nor should he talk obscene nonsense even in intimate conversation with his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Though a man should talk to his wife to prepare her for intimacy, he must be careful of what he says. Note the comments of <i>VaYikra Rabbah</i> 24:7.<br>\"And your camp shall be holy, that He see no lewd things in you\" (Deuteronomy 23:15). The latter refers to unseemly speech. Rav Shmuel bar Nachman said: Lewd speech is obscenity.</i> Behold, the prophet has stated (Amos 4:13): \"And He repeats to a man what he has spoken.\" [On this verse,] our Sages<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Chagigah</i> 5b</i> commented: A person will have to account<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">when being judged in the afterworld...</i> for even the light conversation that he has with his wife.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">for every aspect of a man's behavior is significant.</i><br>[At the time of relations,] they should not be drunk,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For intimate relations to be a meaningful act, each of the partners must have all his faculties at his command.<br>As mentioned in the following halachah, a proper attitude toward intimate relations will cause one to father children who are refined and attractive. The converse is also true. If parents engage in intimate relations in a coarse manner or if there is friction and lack of harmony between them, the children born of their union will have undesirable character traits.<br>In particular, <i>Nedarim</i> 20b describes ten situations in which relations are forbidden and states that the children born of such unions are endowed with extremely negative tendencies. One of the undesirable states at the time of relations is drunkenness. See also the following halachah and <i>Hilchot Issurei Bi'ah</i> 21:12.</i> nor lackadaisical,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">People should not engage in relations except when motivated by desire (preferably a holy desire as explained in Chapter 3). For this reason, as mentioned below, a husband should spend time arousing his wife's desires.</i> nor tense<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Some manuscripts have <i>atzubim</i>- \"depressed\" - instead. Neither state of mind conforms to the attitude desired by the Torah as mentioned below.</i> - [neither both of them,] or [even] one of them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The act of intimacy should be a true union between man and wife. Therefore, the partners must work on developing a single state of mind.</i> She should not be asleep, nor should the man take her by force,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These two situations are also included among the ten prohibited relations mentioned in <i>Nedarim</i> 20b.<br><b>against her will. -</b> The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that this statement also implies that one should not compel his wife to agree to intimate relations. See <i>Eiruvin</i> 100b.<br><b>Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy. He should converse and dally with her somewhat, -</b> <i>Chagigah</i> 5b describes how the Sage, Rav, would abandon all formalities and inspire an atmosphere of relaxed happiness before intimacy. (Note the description of Rav in Chapter 2, Halachah 4.)<br><b>so that she be relaxed. -</b> <i>Iggeret HaKodesh</i> states:<br><b>You should motivate her with words that move her heart and settle her mind and make her happy so that your mind will be fused with hers, and your intent with her intent.You should say some things that arouse her desire, feelings of connection, love, will, and romance, and others which lead her to the fear of God, piety, and modesty.<br></b><br><b>He should be intimate [with her] modestly and not boldly, and withdraw [from her] immediately. -</b> The commentaries note that the Rambam's statements are based on the following passage from <i>Nedarim</i> 20b:<br>They asked Ima Shalom (the wife of Rabbi Eliezer): \"Why are your children so attractive?\"She replied to them: \"He only engages in relations with me... at midnight. During intimacy, he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth (i.e., engages in intimacy modestly) and it appears that a demon is pressuring him\" (i.e., he would withdraw after completing the act of intimacy).</i> against her will. Rather, [the relations should take place] amidst their mutual consent and joy. He should converse and dally with her somewhat, so that she be relaxed. He should be intimate [with her] modestly and not boldly, and withdraw [from her] immediately."

            "english": "Torah Sages conduct themselves with exceptional modesty.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">With this statement, the Rambam establishes a connection with the previous halachah and sets the motif for what follows. Modesty is not simply a matter of dress, (this is discussed in halachah 9), but rather, an awareness of God which causes a person to cover head and body out of respect for the Divine Presence. The Rambam expands upon this concept in the <i>Guide for the Perplexed</i> (Vol. III, Chapter 52):<br>He is constantly with us, observing us, as [Jeremiah 23:24] proclaims: 'Can a man hide himself in the secret places and I not see him,' says God.\" Understand this well.Know that when perfect men comprehend this, they achieve such humility, such awe and fear of God and a sense of shame before Him... that their private behavior with their wives and in latrines is like their public conduct with other people.Know that they have forbidden a man to walk with an erect carriage, because: \"the entire world is filled with His glory\" (Isaiah 6:3)... We are always in His presence... Thus, the greatest among the Sages found it difficult to bare their heads because the Divine Presence constantly hovers over man.</i> They do not demean themselves and do not bare their heads<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Kiddushin</i> 30a relates that Rabbi Chiya bar Abba once saw Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi taking his son to school while wearing a makeshift hat. When Rabbi Chiya asked him the reason he was wearing such a head-covering, he explained that he was forced to leave his home in a hurry and was not able to arrange his turban. Nevertheless, he found it preferable to wear even a makeshift head-covering, rather than go out bareheaded.<br><i>Kiddushin</i> 31a quotes Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yeshoshua, as explaining that he would not walk four cubits bareheaded out of respect for \"the Divine Presence which is above my head.\" (See also <i>Zohar</i>, Vol. III, p. 245b.) Similarly, <i>Shabbat</i> 156b relates that an astrologer told Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak's mother that he was destined to be a thief. From his earliest childhood, she trained him to avoid this fate. She would constantly tell him to cover his head \"so that the fear of God will be upon you.\"</i> or their bodies.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Mishnah Berurah</i> (2:1) lays down the following general rule: Any portion of our bodies which is usually covered should not be revealed unless there is a specific reason for doing so.<br>Modesty, as understood in the present context, results from the awareness of the Divine Presence. The ordinary man experiences such awareness while at prayer when \"he is as if standing before the Divine Presence\" (<i>Hilchot Tefilah</i> 4:16) and then he is required not to bare his head (ibid. 5:5) or various parts of his body; e.g., his chest (ibid. 4:7) and his feet (ibid. 5:5). As emphasized in Chapter 3, Halachah 3, a wise man should try to be conscious of the Divine Presence at all times and places. As a result, he will constantly be modest.<br>Though in Talmudic times and in the Rambam's era, personal modesty and covering one's head were considered the signs of a Sage (<i>Kiddushin</i> 8a) and a unique and special merit (<i>Shabbat</i> 118b), at present, both practices have been accepted as ordinary behavior for all observant Jews.<br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. - <i>Tamid</i> 27b quotes Rav as giving his son the following advice: \"Sit and reveal yourself. Cover yourself and stand.\"</i><br>Even when one enters a latrine, he should be modest and not uncover himself until he is seated. He should not wipe himself clean with the right hand.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the right hand is used to tie <i>Tefillin</i> (<i>Berachot</i> 62a) and is given priority over the left hand regarding service in the Temple (<i>Zevachim</i> 24a), the installation ceremony of priests (Leviticus 8:23), and other ritual manners, it is not proper that it be used for this function.<br>Many authorities maintain that this restriction only applies when one is cleaning oneself with one's hand alone, but not when one uses toilet paper.</i> He should stay away from all others and enter a chamber beyond a chamber, a cave within a cave, and relieve himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 62b derives this law from I Samuel 24:3's description of the behavior of King Saul. Though it is forbidden to delay relieving oneself (<i>Hilchot Ma'achalot Asurot</i> 17:31), our Sages did not give this prohibition precedence over the dictates of modesty (<i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 3:11).</i> If<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">no latrine is available and</i> he [must] relieve himself<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These restrictions only apply to defecation. The Sages feared that refraining from urination might be damaging (<i>Bechorot</i> 44b).</i> behind a fence, he should move far enough away that no one can hear the sound if he breaks wind.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., even though an observer might see that he is squatting and thus, conclude that he is defecating, since the fence covers his lower body, there is no difficulty (<i>Berachot</i> 62a).</i> If he [must] relieve himself in an open area,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">where such a barrier is not available</i> he should be far enough off so that no one can see him baring himself.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">i.e., though the ultimate reason for modesty is the awareness of God's presence, there also is a dimension of modesty which implies respect for one's fellow man and restraint in revealing one's body and bodily functions in his presence.</i><br>One should not speak while relieving himself, even if there is great need.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 62a states that \"modesty and silence are appropriate for the latrine.\" <i>Sanhedrin</i> 19a states that women are allowed to speak in the latrine to prevent men from entering.</i> Just as he conducts himself with modesty while in the latrine by day, he should [also] do so at night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i>, ibid. Since modesty is practiced out of an awareness of God's presence, there is no difference between day and night (The Guide to the Perplexed, Vol. III, Chapter 52).</i><br>One should always train himself to relieve himself in the early morning and after dark only, so that he [need] not go far off.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">to avoid others seeing him (<i>Berachot</i>, ibid.).</i>"

One should only speak to them gently and treat them only with honor. One should not cause pain to their persons with [overbearing] work or aggravate their feelings with harsh words and [one should] show more consideration for their financial interests than for one's own.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Berachot</i> 18b relates that Shmuel's father was given money belonging to orphans to guard. He placed his own money above and below theirs so that he would suffer any possible loss and not they. Similarly, many leniencies and provisions have been instituted within Torah law to protect the interests of orphans. For example, a person who collects a debt from an estate left to orphans must take an oath that the debt had not been repaid even though, had the debtor remained alive, the oath would not have been required.<br>See also <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i>, Chapter 11.</i> Anyone who vexes or angers them, hurts their feelings, oppresses them, or causes them financial loss transgresses this prohibition.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The violation of the prohibition is thus dependent on the feelings of the widow or orphans in question. There is no objective standard of behavior. Rather, one must become sensitive to the feelings of the people who have suffered the loss and conduct himself accordingly.</i> Surely this applies if one beats them or curses them.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Beating and cursing also involve the transgression of other prohibitions.

Though punishment is not given for a transgression that does not involve a deed as mentioned in Halachah 5, it is possible that a person will commit a deed that aggravates a widow or orphan. Why does he not receive lashes in such an instance?<br>The <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> states that since the nature of the prohibition is very subjective, the Torah does not specify any punishment. The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> quotes an opinion which maintains that any prohibition that can be violated by speech or thought alone (as is possible in this case) is not liable for lashes even when it is transgressed with a deed. The <i>Avodat HaMelech</i> states that the reason one does not receive lashes is stated by the Rambam himself, namely:</i> the retribution one suffers for its [violation] is explicitly stated in the Torah (<i>ibid.</i> 22:23): \"I will display My anger and slay you with the sword.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">and this punishment is more severe than lashes. Hence, the lesser punishment is not administered.</i> There is a covenant between them and He who spoke and created the world<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When people lose a loved one, they often despair and feel that the world is run in a random and arbitrary manner.

However, though the concept the Rambam mentions is also alluded to in <i>Bava Kama</i> 93a, the exact expression he uses is not mentioned there.<br>This instance supports an opinion frequently expressed by certain commentaries, i.e., that the Rambam had at his disposal midrashic sources which are not available to us. Alternatively, we are forced to say the Rambam takes the liberty of developing Halachic interpretations of Biblical verses on his own. Scholars of the post-Talmudic period would rarely make such interpretations.<br>When does the above apply? When one causes them suffering for one's own purposes. However, it is permitted for a teacher to cause them suffering while teaching them Torah, or a craft, or in order to train them in proper behavior. - This point is mentioned explicitly in the <i>Mechilta</i> of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The <i>Mechilta</i> which is most commonly quoted is that composed by Rabbi Yishmael.

            "english": "A person who takes revenge against a colleague transgresses a Torah prohibition, as [Leviticus 19:18] states: \"Do not take revenge.\"<br>Even though [revenge] is not punished by lashes, it is a very bad trait. Instead, a person should [train himself] to rise above his feelings about all worldly things, for men of understanding consider all these things as vanity and emptiness which are not worth seeking revenge for.<br>What is meant by taking revenge? A person's colleague asks him, \"Lend me your hatchet. He responds, \"I refuse to lend it to you.\" On the following day, the person [who refused] needs to borrow a hatchet from his colleague. He asks him: \"Lend me your hatchet.\" The latter responds, \"Just as you did not lend it to me, I will not lend it to you.\" This is considered as taking revenge. Instead, when he comes to ask him for it, he should give it to him with a full heart, without repaying him for what he did.<br>The same applies in other similar instances. Thus, King David proclaimed regarding his exemplary qualities [Psalms 7:5]: \"Have I repaid those who have done evil to me? Behold, I have rescued those who hated me without cause.\""

Reuven asked Shimon, \"Rent this house to me,\" or \"lend this ox to me,\" and Shimon was not willing [to do so]. A few days later, Shimon came to borrow or rent something from him. Reuven told him, \"Here, it is. I am lending it to you. I am not like you, nor am I paying you back for what you did.\"<br>A person who acts in this manner violates the prohibition against bearing a grudge. Instead [of doing so], he should wipe the matter from his heart and never bring it to mind. As long as he brings the matter to mind and remembers it, there is the possibility that he will seek revenge. Therefore, the Torah condemned holding a grudge, [requiring] one to wipe the wrong from his heart entirely, without remembering it at all.<br>This is a proper quality which permits a stable environment, trade, and commerce to be established among people."
