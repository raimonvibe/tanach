If Shimon transgressed and entered Reuven's house and benefited from his property without Reuven's knowledge, Reuven is exempt, for [his oath was violated] due to forces beyond his control.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For he did not know of Shimon's actions.</i> Shimon is liable, for he performed a deed prohibited to him. For Reuven took an oath only with regard to a matter within his property.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Tur</i> questions the Rambam's ruling, focusing on the difference between an oath (<i>sh'vuah</i>) and a vow (<i>neder</i>). When taking an oath, a person causes his own person to be prohibited against performing a particular action. To use <i>yeshivah</i> terminology, it is an <i>issur gavra</i>; the prohibition is on the person. When taking a vow, by contrast, he places the prohibition on the object. It is an <i>issur cheftzah</i>.<br>Now when a person takes a vow against a colleague benefiting from his property, there is no difficulty, because he is placing the prohibition on the property. How can he, however, place a prohibition on a colleague's person? How can his oath take effect?<br>The Rambam's ruling is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 236:3; albeit using slightly different wording). The <i>Turei Zahav</i> 236:7 explains that the Rambam follows the principal stated by the Ramban that an oath expressed using the wording of a vow and a vow expressed using the wording of an oath is binding. The Radbaz, puzzled by the same difficulty, states that this refers to an instance where the colleague answered <i>Amen</i> to the oath.</i> Similar laws apply in all analogous situations."

To support his argument, he refers to <i>Nedarim</i> 64b which states that God encouraged Moses to nullify his vow not to return to Egypt, telling him that the people who caused him to flee had died. The Talmud explains that the individuals concerned, Datan and Aviram, had not actually died; they merely became impoverished and \"a poor person is considered as if he died.\" Since poverty is a frequent occurrence, it was appropriate for God to encourage Moses to ask to have his oath repealed. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam would also accept this principle, but the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> differs.</i><br>What is implied? One took an oath not to derive benefit from so-and-so and that person became the city scribe. Since the person did not regret taking the oath, we do not encourage him [to take] the option [of having the oath released]. Even if he himself said: \"If I knew that [he would be given this position], I would not have taken this oath,\" we still do not release him from it. For he does not regret [having taken the oath]. Instead, his desire is that he should not derive benefit from him, but that person not to be appointed the scribe.

The <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 30) states that the transgression is Scriptural in origin and the violator should be punished by lashing. This opinion is also mentioned by the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 215:6. From the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Milah</i> 3:6, it appears that even the Rambam would consider the prohibition as Rabbinic in nature. The latter understanding is shared by many other <i>Rishonim</i>. Their position is - as explained by the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 215:3 - since he is reciting a blessing, his mention of God's name is not entirely frivolous.</i> because he takes God's name in vain,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the gloss of Rabbi Akiva Eiger who questions the Rambam's statements, based on the ruling that a person who is unsure whether or not he recited the Grace After Meals must recite the blessing again. Seemingly, the recitation of that blessing would be problematic, because there is a doubt whether or not he is required to do so or not. Thus it is possible that he is transgressing a Scriptural commandment.<br>In resolution, Rabbi Akiva Eiger explains that since the person is obligated to recite the blessing, even if that obligation stems from a doubt, he is not considered to be taking God's name in vain.</i> as we explained in <i>Hilchot Berachot</i>,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Chapter 1, Halachah 15.</i> he must place him under a ban of ostracism.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the concluding chapters of <i>Hilchot Talmud Torah</i> for a description of the implications of this ban.</i> If he does not, he himself should be ostracized. The ban should, however, be lifted immediately so that it will not present an obstacle to others, for they will not know that he was placed under a ban. And if one would say, \"Make it known that he [is under ostracism],\" the entire populace will be under ban for [people] have already habituated their tongues to iniquity<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Cf.
