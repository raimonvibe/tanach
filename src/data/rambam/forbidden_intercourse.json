When, by contrast, a man engages in relations, there is no concept of being compelled against his will. For an erection is always a willful act.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad takes issue with the Rambam on this point, explaining that if a man develops an erection with the intent of having relations with his wife and while he is still erect, he is compelled to engage in forbidden relations, he is considered to have acted against his will. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that even the Rambam would accept such a ruling.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states, however, that there are authorities who maintain that if a man is compelled to engage in relations at the pain of death, he is considered to have been compelled to act against his will. <i>Yevamot</i> 53b, the source for the Rambam's ruling, is speaking about a situation when a person is not compelled by forces beyond his control. Other authorities maintain that he is liable, even in such a situation. It is, however, unlikely that the Rambam would maintain that the court should actually carry out capital punishment. For in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 5:4, the Rambam writes that a person who is compelled by gentiles to engage in adulterous or incestuous sexual relations should sacrifice his life rather than do so. If, however, he fails to chose martyrdom and transgresses, he should not be punished by the court. It would be difficult to explain that ruling applies only in a situation when he had already developed an erection for a woman with whom he was permitted to engage in relations and was then compelled to engage in forbidden relations. Thus it would appear that the man is not held responsible for capital punishment engaging in relations at the threat of death. [See <i>Bayit Chadash</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 20)].<br>See also the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Sanhedrin</i> 20:2 who states that since developing an erection comes as a result of the man's own pleasure and desire, he is considered to have acted willingly even though he was compelled to engage in the relations.</i><br>When a woman is compelled into relations at the outset and afterwards, she consents, she is not liable. Once [a man] compels her to engage in relations, it is beyond her control whether to desire [or] not. For man's natural tendency and inclination is compelling her to desire.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Ketubot</i> 51a states that even if the woman says: \"Let him continue, for had he not taken me by force, I would have hired him,\" she is considered as acting under duress and freed of liability.

For example, a person intended to cut produce that was not connected to the ground and in the course of doing so also cut produce that was connected to the ground. But with regard to sexual relations, how is it possible to say that a man performed the act without intention? As stated above, \"an erection is always a willful act.\"<br>Based on <i>Hilchot Shegagot</i> 2:7, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> interprets this as referring to an instance in which a person intended to engage in relations with his wife, but accidentally engaged in relations with his sister.</i>Similar concepts apply with regard to one who enters into relations with women forbidden by a negative commandment alone or with one of the <i>shniyot</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's statements and the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that this clause is a printing error, for there is no sacrifice associated with these transgressions. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> offers a resolution, explaining that although he is not punished by an earthly court, nor is he obligated to bring a sacrifice, the transgressor is liable to God. He will reckon with the transgression on His scales of judgment. Rav David Arameah states that this teaches that the person has an obligation to confess his sin.</i><br>When, however, a man has relations with one of the <i>arayot</i> after she died, he is not liable at all.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Yevamot</i> 55b derives this concept through the techniques of Biblical exegesis.</i> Needless to say, this applies with regard to those women with whom relations are forbidden by a negative commandment alone.

Hence the citation of a Scriptural verse is merely an <i>asmachta</i>, a support, and not a direct Scriptural command (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i><br>For how long [is it necessary to refrain from relations]? If [the woman] would ordinarily begin menstruating during the day, she is forbidden to enter into relations from the beginning of the day. If she would ordinarily begin menstruating during the night, she is forbidden to enter into relations from the beginning of the night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 184:7 states that this applies only when a woman is accustomed to begin menstruating at a given time during the day or night. If, however, she does not have a fixed time when she begins menstruating, relations are also forbidden during the preceding day or night. This stringency is not, however, accepted by all authorities.</i>"

Afterwards, [she counts] another seven days and another eleven days.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The simple meaning of the Rambam's words is that the same 18 day pattern - 7 days <i>niddah</i>, 11 days <i>zivah</i> - continues throughout a woman's life whether or not she menstruates on those days or not. When she menstruates she must see whether she is in the midst of the days of <i>niddah</i> or the days <i>zivah</i> and follow the appropriate laws.<br>Rashi and Ramban offer a different interpretation. According to their view, the day's of <i>niddah</i> and <i>zivah</i> depend on a woman's circumstances each month. When she menstruates, she begins the days of <i>niddah</i>. If she continues bleeding beyond seven days or if she discovers uterine bleeding after these seven days (but within the next eleven days), she becomes a <i>zavah</i>. She remains in that category until seven \"spotless\" days pass. After those seven days, when she discovers uterine bleeding again, she becomes a <i>niddah</i>. Similarly, if she does not discover uterine bleeding within the eleven days, the next time she discovers uterine bleeding, she is considered as a <i>niddah</i>.<br>There are Talmudic passages which appear to support both positions. The position of Rashi and the Ramban appears to be closer to a woman's actual physical pattern and the commentaries question why the Rambam - a doctor - did not take note of this dimension. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 183) follows the view shared by Rashi and the Ramban. In practice, however, this difference of opinion is not relevant at all, for as stated in Chapter 11, at present, Jewish women have accepted the stringency of counting seven \"spotless\" days whenever they discover even the slightest uterine bleeding. Hence, whatever their status actually is, they will certainly not transgress.</i><br>Take care of this reckoning so that you will know [a woman's status] if she discovers blood. Was it in the days of <i>niddah</i> or the days of <i>zivah</i>?

There would be a difference in law if on the fourth occasion after the interval, she did not jump. Is she forbidden to engage in relations or not. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> maintains that according to the Rambam, she would be forbidden, because the Rambam does not attach any significance to the external factors.

This opinion is also reflected in the ruling of the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 190:41).

The minor <i>zavah</i> is impure and the woman after childbirth and the virgin are pure regardless of the stain.<br>As stated in Chapter 11, the concept of a minor <i>zavah</i> does not apply in the present age and instead, she is considered as equivalent to a major <i>zavah</i>. Hence a stain can certainly be attributed to her. The laws concerning a woman with hymeneal bleeding or a woman after childbirth are different, for in the present age, we do not consider such woman as ritually pure. Instead, uterine bleeding - and even a stain - renders them ritually impure. Accordingly, since the status of these woman will be impaired because of the discovery of the stain, there is reason to assume that it should not be attributed to them alone, but instead, both the borrower and the lender should be considered impure as in the following clause. {See the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 190) which cites such views.} The commentaries explain, however, that according to the Rambam, this law applies even in the present era. Indeed, it is quoted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 190:42) and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> only quotes laws that apply in the present era.<br>The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 190:54 explains that even though the halachic status of these women changed in the present era, their physical tendency did not change. They frequently experience uterine bleeding and hence, we attribute the stain to them.</i><br>[A different ruling applies,] however, if she lent [a garment] to a minor <i>zavah</i> on the day she is watching or a major <i>zavah</i> during her seven \"spotless\" days, put it on before checking it and then discovered a stain. [In such an instance,] the halachic status of both is impaired., the lender and the borrower. For perhaps this one caused the stain or perhaps the other did.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">92</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Both the lender and the borrower are not likely to experience uterine bleeding and for both, it will impair their halachic status. Since we do not know which one is responsible for the stain, both share the resulting halachic liability.<br>The <i>Tur</i> and the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah, loc. cit.</i>) differ with the Rambam's ruling and maintain that the owner of the garment is pure. Since the status of the woman who is seeking to attain ritual purity is already impaired when compared to that of the owner, the stain is attributed to her alone despite the fact that her status will become further impaired by this ruling.</i><br>If she lent [the garment] to a woman who is watching herself because of the discovery of a stain, she may not attribute the stain to her. [The rationale is that] we do not attribute one stain to another.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">93</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although a woman is considered impure because of a stain, we do not consider it a certain enough sign of uterine bleeding to attribute another stain to it.</i>"

There is no obligation to convert. A gentile who observes the seven universal laws commanded to Noah and his descendants is on a very high rung. Hence unless a gentile is motivated by a very sincere commitment, it is preferable for him not to change his status and serve God in his present state.</i> If they accept [this introduction] and do not abandon their resolve and thus we see that they are motivated by love, we accept them, as [indicated by Ruth 1:18]: \"And she saw that she was exerting herself to continue with her and she ceased speaking with her.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">At first, Naomi tried to dissuade Ruth from converting.

This makes it obvious that the distinction in the laws results from their change in status (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i><br>A convert is forbidden to marry his maternal relatives after they convert according to Rabbinic Law.

            "english": "We operate under the presumption that all families are of acceptable lineage and it is permitted to marry their descendants as an initial and preferred option.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is stating that it is not necessary to investigate thoroughly the lineage of a family before marrying into them. If it is a common presumption that a family is of acceptable lineage, one may marry a family member at the outset. When we know nothing of the lineage of the family, there are some authorities [Remo as quoted by the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 2)] who maintain that we do question his lineage and require proof that he is acceptable. Others (Rabbenu Asher and Rabbenu Nissim) differ and maintain that even if we do not know anything about a family's lineage, we assume that they are acceptable. See the discussion of the issue by <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 2:3.<br>The debate concerns the practice in the Talmudic age and in subsequent eras when Jewish observance was strong. At present, particularly in contemporary communities when there are many non-observant Jews and non-halachic divorce and similar problems are rampart, it is customary for Rabbinic courts to be careful and investigate the lineage of people before performing a marriage.</i> Nevertheless, if you see two families continuously quarreling with each other, you see one family that is always involved with strife and controversy, or you see a person who frequently quarrels with people at large and is very insolent, we suspect [their lineage]. It is fitting to distance oneself from such people for these are disqualifying characteristics.<br>Similarly, a person who always slurs the lineage of others, casting aspersions on the ancestry of families or individuals, claiming that they are <i>mamzerim</i>, we are suspicious that he himself is a <i>mamzer</i>. Similarly, if he calls others servants, we suspect that he is a servant. For whoever denigrates others, denigrates them with a blemish that he himself possesses.<br>Similarly, whenever a person is characterized by insolence and cruelty, hating people and not showing kindness to them, we seriously suspect that he is a Gibeonite. For the distinguishing signs of the holy nation of Israel is that they are meek, merciful, and kind. With regard to the Gibeonites, [II Samuel 21:2] states: \"The Gibeonites are not of the Jewish people.\" For they acted extremely brazenly and would not be appeased. They did not show mercy to the sons of [King] Saul, nor did they show kindness to the Jews to forgive the descendants of their king,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the notes to Chapter 12, Halachah 23, as related in II Samuel, ch. 21, there was a famine for three years in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>. Through prophetic vision, David learned that the reason for the famine was Saul's oppression of the Gibeonites (exactly what Saul did to oppress them is a matter of discussion among the Rabbis). David asked the Gibeonites what they desired to be appeased for this oppression. They answered that they wanted to slay seven of his descendants. David handed over seven of Saul's descendants to them and they hung them and left their corpses on the gallows. For this act of cruelty, David decreed that they should never marry among the Jewish people.</i> while [the Jews] had shown them kindness and allowed them to live.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Joshua, Chapter 9, relates that after the Jews' conquest of Jericho and Ai, the inhabitants of Gibeon:<br>Acted cunningly... They took old sacks upon their donkeys, old and rent wine bottles... old, worn and patched shoes... and came to Joshua at Gilgal. They told him:... \"We have come from a distant country. Therefore, make a covenant with us.\" Joshua made a covenant with them... and the princes of the congregation swore to them.<br>After the ruse was discovered, Joshua and the people honored the covenant and allowed the Gibeonites to live. Moreover, they even came to their defense when they were attacked by other Canaanite nations.</i>"

Why then is a woman not warned with regard to this matter?<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> (quoting Rashi's commentary to <i>Kiddushin</i> 76a) states that here, the Rambam intent is that since the Torah did not forbid a woman of the priestly family from marrying a <i>challal</i>, our Sages did not require a woman to make an investigation even when there is a question whether her future husband is entirely unacceptable.<br>According to Rashi who interprets \"disputing a family's lineage\" (Halachah 18) as merely casting aspersions, this interpretation is tenable. After all, we have no hard and fast evidence that the man's lineage is unacceptable. But according to the Rambam, who defines that term as referring to testimony delivered in court, the original question remains. Since there is a firm possibility that a Scriptural prohibition is involved, why shouldn't a woman be required to make an investigation? Among the resolutions offered is that of the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 2:5 is that the Rambam would require an investigation even when a woman desires to marry. Nevertheless, the investigation need not include all of the eight (or ten) women mentioned by the Rambam. Such thoroughness is required only when a man seeks to marry.<br>See the gloss of the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> to Halachah 18 and the <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 2:3 which cite differing opinions which also require a woman to make a full-fledged investigation of the lineage of a man she desires to marry if there are questions concerning his lineage.</i>"

When Ezra led the people back to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> after the 70 years of the Babylonian exile, the majority of the people did not accompany him. (Moreover, he did not conquer the land.)

Although other <i>Rishonim</i> (Ra'avad, Rav Moshe HaCohen) differ and maintain that Ezra's settlement of the land was sufficient to sanctify it according to Scriptural Law, the Rambam's approach is accepted by most authorities.</i> When Ezra ascended [to <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>], the entire people did not ascend.<br>Similarly, in the present era, <i>terumah</i> is a Rabbinic commandment.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam maintains that the laws regarding <i>terumah</i> and the tithes are derived from those applying to <i>challah</i> (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i> to <i>Hilchot Terumah</i> 1:26).</i> Therefore it is eaten by the priests of our era [whose lineage is established merely] by presumption."
