If an animal with a permanent blemish<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It had a permanent blemish before it was consecrated.</i> gives birth while it is consecrated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., before it was redeemed.</i> the offspring must be redeemed; it then receives the status of an ordinary animal even if it is unblemished.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This represents a departure from the usual practice, because generally, unblemished animals are not redeemed, but are offered as sacrifices; see <i>Teumrah</i> 33b.</i> [The rationale is that] a secondary entity should not be treated with greater severity than the primary entity.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., it would not be appropriate for the animal that was consecrated not to be offered as a sacrifice and its offspring, which was never directly consecrated, to be used for that purpose.</i> If it became pregnant before it was redeemed and it gave birth after it was redeemed, the offspring has the status of an ordinary animal.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For it was redeemed together with its mother.</i> If [the consecrated animal that was blemished] died before it was redeemed, it should be redeemed after it died.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And then its meat can be used even as food for animals, and certainly for humans. Moreover, a formal process of evaluation by a court is not required before its redemption.</i> [The rationale is that] holiness never encompassed its actual body, only its worth, because it had a permanent blemish.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is explaining why leniency is granted to redeem it after it died although generally we do not redeem a consecrated animal to feed its meat to the dogs (Chapter 2, Halachah 10; based on <i>Temurah</i> 6:5). In this instance, however, because the animal was blemished permanently, the consecration never affected its actual body, only its worth (i.e., it was not destined to be sacrificed itself, but rather to be sold and the proceeds used to purchase a sacrifice). Hence, after it dies, it can still be sold after it is redeemed.</i><br>If, by contrast, one consecrates an animal that possesses a temporary blemish or he consecrates an unblemished animal and after he consecrated it, it contracted a permanent blemish [different laws apply]. If it died before it was redeemed, it should be buried like other unblemished consecrated animals,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">47</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rather than redeemed. See <i>Hilchot Pesulei HaMukdashim</i> 19:11.</i> because it must be stood before the court and evaluated,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">48</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And this process of evaluation must be performed while the animal is alive.</i> as we explained in <i>[Hilchot] Arachin</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">49</sup><i class=\"footnote\"><i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 5:12.</i> If it was slaughtered before it was redeemed, it may be redeemed as long as it is making convulsive motions.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For as long as it is making convulsive motions, it is considered alive and the process of evaluation can take place (<i>ibid.</i>:13).</i> Afterwards, one may partake of it. If it gave birth, its offspring may be sacrificed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">51</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 4:9.</i> If it became pregnant before it was redeemed<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">52</sup><i class=\"footnote\">But after it contracted a permanent blemish.</i> and it gave birth before it was redeemed, the offspring is forbidden.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">53</sup><i class=\"footnote\">To be used for ordinary purposes by Rabbinic decree. Although according to Scriptural Law, its holiness has departed, our Sages forbade its use, lest many such animals be maintained and flocks of them raised (<i>Bechorot</i> 15b).</i> It may not be redeemed. What should be done? Before the mother is redeemed, the offspring should be dedicated to the same [type of] sacrifice as its mother,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">54</sup><i class=\"footnote\">It then receives holiness on its own accord, independent of its mother.</i> because it may not be offered because of [the sanctification of] its mother, because its [holiness] comes from sanctification that was suspended.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the mother was unfit to be sacrificed because of its blemish, its holiness is considered to be suspended. Because the holiness of the mother was suspended, the offspring is not considered to be consecrated to the complete extent. Hence it must be consecrated again.<br>(It must be noted that the commentaries have questioned this ruling, because in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 15:4, the Rambam writes that the holiness of consecrated animals is never suspended. It can, however, be explained that a suspension stemming from a permanent blemish is different, because the animal can never be fit for sacrifice again. See a parallel in <i>Hilchot Temurah</i> 3:4.)</i>"

Accordingly, since the obligation for lashes is explicit, even though it could be derived by logical inference, we should not make such a conclusion.

It reaches that conclusion for it is obvious that if the animal was not consecrated beforehand, its offering is not acceptable, for a person cannot consecrate an object that does not belong to him.</i> and the Holy One, blessed be He, hates it, as [Isaiah 61:8] states: \"[I am God Who...] hates a burnt offering [obtained] through robbery.\" Needless to say, it is not accepted. If the owner despairs of its return, the sacrifice is acceptable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When it comes to questions of monetary law, the owner's despair of the object's return is not enough to cause it to be acquired by the thief (<i>Hilchot Geneivah</i> 5:2-3; <i>Hilchot Gezelah Va'Avedah</i> 2:1). Nevertheless, it is possible to say that according to Scriptural Law, the owner's despair is enough to effect the transfer of the property, further requirements are Rabbinic in origin and the Sages did not apply their decrees with regard to a sacrifice (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>). Alternatively, with regard to questions of monetary law, a change of possession together with the owner's despair is sufficient to effect the transfer of the property (<i>Hilchot Geneivah, loc. cit.</i>). Similarly, in this instance, consecration of the animal is comparable to a change of possession (<i>Lechem Mishneh</i>, gloss to <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 18:14).</i> [This applies] even<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's words imply that certainly the concept would apply if a burnt-offering was involved, but even when a sin-offering is involved, the principle is applied, implying that a sin-offering is a more severe issue than a burnt offering. The Ra'avad differs and maintains that the word \"even\" should be omitted, implying that the two types of sacrifices are of equal standing.<br>(A similar concept applies with regard to the conclusion of the halachah: The <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> suggests amending the text to read: \"How much more so does this apply with regard to a burnt-offering?!\" I.e., according to the Rambam, the sin offering is considered more severe, while the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> maintains that the burnt offering deserves more weight.)<br>The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam uses \"even\" in reference to the first clause, even though the priests partake of such a sacrifice, it is unacceptable.</i> if it is a sin-offering and thus the priests partake of its meat.<br>For the sake of the enhancement of the altar's [honor], it was decreed that if it became public knowledge that a sin-offering was obtained through robbery, it does not bring about atonement even if the owner despaired of its return, so that it will not be said that the altar consumes stolen property.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Radbaz asks: How can our Sages rule that the sacrifice is unacceptable and require that the person bring another offering? Since according to Scriptural Law, he has fulfilled his obligation, bringing the second sacrifice is in fact transgressing, for he is slaughtering an ordinary animal in the Temple Courtyard (see <i>Hilchot Shechitah</i> 2:1). The Radbaz answers that from this we see the power of the Sages: that if there is a significant reason - as in this instance - their decrees can nullify the validity of the first sacrifice. Hence, when the person brings the second sacrifice, he is bringing a sacrifice required of him, not an ordinary animal.</i> Similar laws apply with regard to a burnt offering."
