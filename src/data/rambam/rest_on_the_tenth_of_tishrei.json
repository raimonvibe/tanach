As such, the Oral Tradition (<i>Yoma</i> 76a) explains that there are five different activities forbidden on that day and cites (<i>ibid.</i> 76a-77a) various allusions to these five prohibitions. The terms he uses for allusions, <i>asmachta'ot</i>, indicates that he does not view the four prohibitions other than eating and drinking as having the status of a Torah commandment.<br>Similarly, the punishment that he states should be given for these activities, \"stripes for rebellion,\" is the punishment received for transgressing a Rabbinic commandment.<br>[It must be noted that this matter was a question on which the Rambam deliberated. For an early edition of his Commentary on the Mishnah states that one should receive lashes for performing these activities, indicating that, at that time, he saw them as forbidden by the Torah itself. Similarly, the Rambam's wording in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) appears to indicate that these prohibitions are forbidden by the Torah itself. This view is advanced by several authorities including Rabbenu Nissin, the <i>Magen Avraham</i> 611, and the <i>Shulchan Aruch HaRav</i> 611:2.]<br>Based on the explanations above, it would appear that the term \"according to the Oral Tradition\" as used in this halachah has a different meaning from that in the previous halachah. In the previous halachah, the term denoted an interpretation of a verse in the Torah. Therefore, the prohibition was given the status of a Torah commandment. In this halachah, the term refers to a concept that has been transmitted through a chain of tradition extending back to Moses. Nevertheless, it is a decree that does not stem from a Biblical verse and is therefore considered to be Rabbinic in origin.<br>Other Rabbinic authorities (Rabbenu Asher and the Ashkenazic authorities) clearly state that the prohibitions against these other activities are Rabbinic in nature. Therefore, certain leniencies are granted in their regard, as reflected in Chapter 3, Halachah 1 (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).</i> It is a mitzvah to refrain from these activities in the same way one refrains from eating and drinking.<br>This is derived from [the exegesis of the expression,] \"A Sabbath of Sabbaths.\" \"A Sabbath\" implies refraining from eating; \"of Sabbaths,\" refraining from these activities.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The reference to the phrase \"a Sabbath of Sabbaths\" is taken from <i>Yoma</i> 74a. The interpretation is, however, the Rambam's.<br>Based on the concepts explained above - that the prohibition against the remaining four types of afflictions is Rabbinic in origin and is not based on the explanation of a verse in the Torah - the <i>Ma'aseh Rokeach</i> suggests amending the text to read, \"'A Sabbath' from work; 'of Sabbaths' from these other matters.\" He supports this view by noting that in Halachah 1, the Rambam had cited this expression as a proof-text for the commandment to refrain from work on Yom Kippur.</i><br>One is liable, however, for <i>karet</i> or a sin offering only for eating and drinking. If one washes, anoints oneself, wears shoes, or engages in sexual relations, one receives stripes for rebelliousness."

Although he agrees that the fact that, in his discussion of the prohibition of labor on the Sabbath, the Rambam does not mention the need to add \"from the mundane to the sacred\" supports the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> view, he is reluctant to state that the Rambam differs with all the other authorities on this issue.<br>(See <i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV, which explains the difference between the two perspectives. If we derive the concept of adding \"from the mundane to the sacred\" from Yom Kippur, the obligation revolves around the person, a <i>chiyuv gavra</i> in yeshivah terminology. If, by contrast, the obligation is derived from the prohibition against working on the Sabbath, it is a function of the <i>cheftza</i>, a result of the atmosphere of Sabbath holiness that prevents labor from being performed.)</i> [Since the date of the fast is the tenth,] the intent is [obviously] that one begin fasting and afflicting oneself in the afternoon of the ninth, which directly precedes the tenth.<br>Similarly, at the departure [of the holiday], one should prolong the affliction slightly, [entering] the night of the eleventh, which follows the tenth, as [implied by <i>ibid.</i>]: \"From evening to evening, you shall keep this day of refraining.\""
