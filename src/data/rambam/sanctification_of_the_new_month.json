He generally begins by citing a mitzvah and the proof-text from which it is derived, and afterwards he describes it. In this instance, the Rambam begins by describing the basic ground rules for the sighting of the moon, and afterwards he explains the mitzvah that is associated with this sighting.<br>Rav Kapach suggests that this approach could have been taken in reaction to the position of Rav Sa'adiah Gaon, who maintains that the fundamental aspect of determining the calendar was not the sighting of the moon, but rather the calculations of the Sages. See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 2:6).</i> so that they will know the day [on which to celebrate] the festivals [as implied by Leviticus 23:2]: \"that you will pronounce as days of holy convocation,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in the conclusion of Chapter 2, this verse is an indication that the determination of the days on which the festivals are to be celebrated - and thus the establishment of the monthly calendar on which the former depends - was entrusted to the Jewish High Court.</i> and [as implied by Exodus 13:10]: \"And you shall observe this statute in its appointed season.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This verse refers to the Paschal sacrifice and teaches us that there is an obligation to \"observe this statute,\" bring the Paschal sacrifice, \"at its appointed time\" - i.e., in the spring. This alludes to the second dimension of this mitzvah, the establishment of leap years so that the holiday of Pesach will always fall in the spring.<br>Note the Ramban (<i>Hasagot</i> to <i>Sefer HaMitzvot, Shoresh</i> 1), who cites opinions that consider these two dimensions - the establishment of Rosh Chodesh and the decision whether to observe leap years - as two separate mitzvot.<br>The Rambam's citation of this proof-text has attracted the attention of commentaries because of another difficulty. In <i>Menachot</i> 36b, the meaning of this verse is the subject of a difference of opinion between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili. While the simple meaning of the phrase \"this statute\" is the Paschal sacrifice - and this is the interpretation of Rabbi Akiva - Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili interprets the phrase as referring to the mitzvah of wearing tefillin.<br>What is significant is that in the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the Rambam cites both the interpretations of Rabbi Akiva (in this halachah) and that of Rabbi Yosse HaG'lili (<i>Hilchot Tefillin</i> 4:10) as Torah law. The commentaries (see Radbaz, Vol. V, Responsum 1693) explain that this is indicative of a general pattern within the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. The Rambam's intent in composing the <i>Mishneh Torah</i> was to provide us with a text of Torah practice, not a source book explaining the derivation of Torah law. He refers to verses only when they are necessary as supports. Therefore, in each instance he cites the proof-text that has the most obvious connection to the law or principle he is referring to, although it is possible that there is another verse from which this law was actually derived.</i>"

[The rationale is] that they saw [the moon] at its appropriate time. [Their testimony] about [what they thought] they saw in the morning is disregarded.

(See the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah for a detailed analysis of this matter.)<br>Rabbi Yochanan ben Nuri maintains that the witnesses' testimony should be disregarded, because it cannot possibly be true. Everyone knows that, at the beginning of the month, the moon always appears on the western horizon for a brief period after the setting of the sun. At this time of the month, seeing it in the morning, before sunrise, is impossible. (See Chapters 15 and 17 for an explanation of this phenomenon.) Since the testimony of these witnesses contains an obvious error, the testimony should be disregarded entirely.<br>Rabban Gamliel, as his opinion is explained by the Rambam, was aware of this astronomical concept as well. Nevertheless, in the instance mentioned in the Mishnah, he knew that according to the calculations, it would have been possible for the moon to have been sighted on the night mentioned by the witnesses. Why then, he argued, should their testimony be discounted entirely because of the error they made regarding the morning. The fact that then, they mistook the condensation of clouds for the moon should not cause their testimony to be disregarded entirely.</i><br>Similarly, if [witnesses claim] to have seen the moon at its appropriate time, but it was not seen on the thirty-first night, their [testimony] is believed. For what is significant for us is only the sighting [of the moon] on the thirtieth night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This represents a parallel difference of opinion mentioned in <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>). Rabbi Dosa ben Hyrkanos maintains that it is impossible for the moon to be sighted on one night, and then for it not to be sighted on the following night.<br>Rabban Gamliel (as his position is explained by the Rambam in his Commentary on the Mishnah) accepted the witnesses' testimony in this instance, because he knew that, according to the calculations, it was possible for the moon to be sighted on the thirtieth night. The fact that it was not sighted again on the thirty-first night was merely a matter of circumstance: no one was trying to see it, their view was obstructed by clouds, or the like.</i>"

To explain: It was easy to calculate the number of conjunctions between one solar eclipse and another. Afterwards, this number would be multiplied by 360 (the number of degrees in a circle) and then divided by the number of years, months, days, or hours (depending on the mean one wanted to reach) that had passed between the two eclipses.<br>In fact, however, the sun - and to a much greater extent, the moon - would deviate from this mean rate of movement - i.e., the position in which they are located in the heavens differs from the position that would be reached by calculating the mean rate of progress. As is explained in the succeeding chapters, there are various ways of correcting and adjusting these mean calculations so that the actual position of these celestial bodies can be determined.</i> The time of the conjunction as calculated in this manner is referred to as the <i>molad</i>.<br>The essentials of the calculations that are used when a court to sanctify [the new moon based on the testimony of witnesses of] the sighting [of the moon] does not exist - i.e., the calculations we use today - are referred to as <i>ibbur</i>.

            "english": "Why is [Rosh HaShanah] not established [on the day of the conjunction] when it falls on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday? Because these calculations determine the conjunction of the sun and the moon only according to their mean [rate of] progress, and do not [necessarily] reflect the true position [of the sun and the moon in the celestial sphere], as explained. Therefore, they instituted that [on] one day [Rosh Chodesh] would be established and on the following day it would be postponed, so that they would ascertain the day when the true conjunction takes place.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's statements have stirred the attention - and often the indignation - of the Ra'avad and other commentaries, because they appear to ignore the explanations given by <i>Rosh HaShanah</i> 20a why Rosh HaShanah never begins on these days. The Talmud states that if Rosh HaShanah falls on either Wednesday or Friday, Yom Kippur will fall on either Friday or Sunday, and thus there would be two consecutive days, Yom Kippur and the Sabbath, when it would be forbidden to bury the dead. In the Talmudic era, this could have caused a corpse to deteriorate, detracting from its honor and respect.<br>Alternatively, the Sages state that if Rosh HaShanah fell on any of these three days, there would be two successive days when it would be forbidden to pick fresh vegetables, and the people would be unable to celebrate the festivals or the Sabbath properly.<br><i>Sukkah</i> 43a gives another reason why Rosh HaShanah is not held on Sunday: were this to be the case, <i>Hoshana Rabbah,</i> the seventh day of Sukkot, would fall on the Sabbath. In such an instance, restrictions were placed on the willow ritual in the Temple. (See <i>Hilchot Shofar, Sukkah V'Lulav</i> 7:21-22.) To avoid such an instance, the Sages structured the calendar so that Rosh HaShanah never falls on Sunday.<br>In defense of the Rambam's position, it must be noted that both earlier (Rabbenu Chanan'el) and subsequent (the <i>P'nei Yehoshua</i>) Talmudic commentaries understood the reasons given by the Talmud as being merely the external dimension of the rationale for the calendar's adjustment, while the inner meaning is associated with the actual position of the sun and the moon in the heavenly sphere.<br>Even according to this perspective, there is, however, a difficulty with the Rambam's statements. Although it is correct that the true positions of the sun and the moon often differ from the position determined by calculating their mean movement, the concept of postponing the celebration of Rosh HaShanah on these three days appears arbitrary and without any obvious connection to the movement of these bodies in the celestial sphere. The commentaries note that explanations why Rosh HaShanah is not celebrated on these days are found in the Kabbalah.</i><br>What is implied? [When according to our calculations, the conjunction occurs on] Tuesday, we establish [Rosh Chodesh]. [When it occurs] on Wednesday, we postpone it. [When it occurs] on Thursday, we establish [Rosh Chodesh]. [When it occurs] on Friday, we postpone it. [When it occurs] on the Sabbath, we establish [Rosh Chodesh]. [When it occurs] on Sunday, we postpone it. [When it occurs] on Monday, we establish [Rosh Chodesh]."

            "english": "The method of calculating [the beginning of] the seasons can be explained as follows. First, it is necessary to calculate the number of [nineteen-year] cycles that have passed until the [nineteen-year] cycle in question. Afterwards, add one hour and 485 units for every [nineteen-year] cycle. Afterwards, group all the units into hours, and all the hours into days. [Once a] total [has been reached], subtract seven days, nine hours, and 642 units [from it].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For the calculations will be based on Rosh Chodesh Nisan, which took place this amount of time after the vernal equinox.</i> Add the remainder to [the time of] the conjunction of Nisan in the first year of the [nineteen-year] cycle in question, and you will be able to know the hour and the date of the the vernal equinox of the first year of this cycle.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A significant point arises from these statements, when one calculates the progression of the date and time of the vernal equinox by adding one hour and 485 units for each nineteen-year cycle. It follows that within the entire six millennia of the world's existence, the vernal equinox will have advanced approximately fifteen days. Thus, from the standpoint of the solar calendar, it will always be possible for Pesach, the fifteenth of Nisan, to occur in the spring.</i> From this date, you can calculate [the beginnings of] all the subsequent seasons [by] adding ninety-one days and seven and one- half hours for every season.<br>If you desire to know [the time and the date of] the vernal equinox of a particular year within a given [nineteen-year] cycle, [the following procedure should be used:] Add one hour and 485 [units] for every [nineteen-year] cycle. For each complete year that has passed within the [nineteen-year] cycle [under discussion], add ten days, twenty-one hours, and 204 units,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference between a lunar year and a solar year, as stated in Chapter 6, Halachah 4.</i>, and then group the entire sum [into days and hours].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., calculate every group of 1080 units as an hour, and every group of 24 hours as a day.</i><br>Afterwards, subtract seven days, nine hours, and 642 units [from this sum]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">By making this subtraction, one bases the calculation on the conjunction of the month of Nisan, and not on the time of the first vernal equinox, which preceded that conjunction by this number of days and hours.</i> and divide the remainder into lunar months of 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 units.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Until this point in the calculation, the Rambam has not taken into consideration the existence of leap years. He does this now by grouping the remainder into months and subtracting the complete months. The number of complete months subtracted represents the number of leap years that have passed in the nineteen-year cycle.</i> [The number of days, hours, and units that] remain [after all the complete] lunar months [have been calculated] should be added to [the day and the time of] the conjunction of Nisan in that year. [In this manner,] you will be able to determine the date and the time of the vernal equinox of the year desired.<br>According to this calculation, the vernal equinox will always take place either at nightfall, at midnight, at daybreak, or at noon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There are 30 hours between the time of the equinox (or solstice) of one year and the next. Since the first vernal equinox took place at nightfall between Tuesday and Wednesday, the second vernal equinox took place at midnight between Wednesday and Thursday, the third at daybreak on Friday, and the fourth at noon on the Sabbath. Similarly, in subsequent years, the time of the equinox will continue to advance in six (i.e., 30) hour intervals according to such a pattern.</i> The summer solstice will always take place at either 7:30 PM, 1:30 AM, 7:30 AM, or 1:30 PM.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a difference of seven and a half hours between the time of the vernal equinox and the time of the summer solstice. Since the first vernal equinox took place at nightfall, the first summer solstice took place at 1:30 AM. Afterwards, the time of the summer solstice advances in six- (i.e., 30-) hour intervals every year, in a manner parallel to the progression of the vernal equinox, as described in the previous note.</i> The autumnal equinox will always take place either at nine or at three o'clock, either in the day or the night.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first autumnal equinox took place at 9 AM. Afterwards, the time of the equinox has advanced in six-hour intervals, as explained.</i> The winter solstice will always take place either at 10:30 PM, 4:30 AM, 10:30 AM, or 4:30 PM.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The first winter solstice took place at 4:30 PM. Afterwards, the time of the solstice has advanced in six-hour intervals, as explained.</i><br>If you desire to know the day of the week and the hour of the equinox, [the following procedure should be used:] Count the number of complete years that have passed from the year of creation until the desired year, and divide them into groups of twenty- eight.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This number is chosen because after twenty-eight years, the equinox takes place on the same day of the week and the same hour as it did originally. This figure can be calculated as follows: 1 and 1/4 days (the difference between the time of the equinox in two successive years) times 28 equals 35 days. Thirty-five days are five full weeks.<br>Based on this calculation, it is each twenty-eight years that the sun returns to its original position at the time of creation. To commemorate this occurrence, a special blessing, <i>Birkat HaChamah</i>, is recited. (See <i>Hilchot Berachot</i> 10:18.)</i> Add one day and six hours<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference in the time of the equinox from one year to the next.</i> for each year remaining.

Because the first equinox of the year of creation took place at the beginning of the fourth day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">19</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the night between Tuesday and Wednesday.

            "english": "The mean distance traveled by the sun in one day - i.e., in twenty-four hours - is 59 minutes and 8 seconds; in symbols 59' 8\".<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the sun travels throughout the entire 360° sphere over the course of a solar year, and a year is slightly longer than 365 days, the daily distance the sun travels is slightly less than one degree - more precisely, 59 minutes, 8 seconds and 19.8 thirds. Although the Rambam does not mention the thirds in this figure, he includes them in his subsequent calculations.</i> Thus, in ten days, it travels 9 degrees, 51 minutes and 23 seconds,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">When performing simple multiplication, the sum appears to be three seconds less. These three seconds have been added because of the inclusion of the multiples of the thirds, as mentioned in the previous note. Similarly, in subsequent calculations the Rambam also adds the multiples of the thirds.</i> in symbols 9° 51' 23\". In one hundred days, it travels 98 degrees, 33 minutes and 53 seconds, in symbols 98° 33' 53\".<br>The remainder [of the degrees] traveled [by the sun] over the course of one thousand days - after all the multiples of 360 have been subtracted, as explained<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 11, Halachah 10.</i> - is 265 degrees, 38 minutes and 50 seconds, in symbols 265° 38' 50\". The remainder [of the degrees] traveled [by the sun] over the course of ten thousand days is 136 degrees, 28 minutes and 20 seconds, in symbols 136° 28' 20\".<br>In this manner, one can multiply [the mean distance of a day] and calculate the distance [traveled] by the sun over any number of days. Similarly, if one would like to make pre-calculated figures for the mean distance for two days, for three days, for four days, up to ten days, one may do so. Similarly, if one desires to make pre-calculated figures for the mean distance for twenty days, for thirty days, for forty days, until one hundred days, one may do so. These figures become evident once one knows the mean distance for a single day.<br>It would be proper for one to know and have prepared the mean distances traveled by the sun in 29 days, and in 354 days, [the latter] being the number of days in a lunar year when the months follow a regular pattern. This is called a regular year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 8, Halachah 6, which explains that a year in which all the months follow in order, one full and one lacking, is referred to as a regular year.</i><br>When you have these figures prepared, it will be easy to calculate the visibility of the moon. For there are 29 full days from the night when the moon was sighted in one month to the night that it may be sighted in the following month. Similarly, each and every month, there will be a difference of 29 days [between the nights on which the moon may be sighted], no more and no less.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A lunar month is slightly longer than 29 days. Therefore, potential witnesses endeavor to sight the moon in the heavens on the night between the twenty-ninth and thirtieth days.</i> [This is what concerns us,] for our sole desire in these calculations is to know [when the moon] will be sighted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">6</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Indeed, many of the subsequent calculations mentioned by the Rambam may be accurate only on the first night of the month and may not be accurate on the subsequent nights.</i><br>Similarly, [the difference in the sun's position] between the night when the moon will be sighted in a particular month one year and the night when it will be sighted [in that month] the following year will be that of a regular year, or that of a regular year plus one day.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">7</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The one day is added when both the months of Marcheshvan and Kislev are full. The commentaries raise the question why the Rambam does not mention the possibility of the year being lacking a day, as occurs when Marcheshvan and Kislev are both lacking.</i><br>The mean distance traveled by the sun in one month is 28 degrees, 35 minutes and one second, in symbols 28° 35' 1\". The distance it travels over the course of a regular [lunar] year is 348 degrees, 55 minutes and 15 seconds, in symbols 348° 55' 15\"."

            "english": "There is one point in the orbit of the sun around the Earth - and similarly, in the orbits of the remainder of the seven stars [around the Earth] - when [the sun or] that star will be furthest removed from the Earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">8</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in Chapter 11, Halachah 13, the Earth is not in the exact center of the orbits of the sun, the moon, or the other five planets. Therefore, there is one point in their orbits where they are furthest removed from the Earth. The knowledge of the location of this point is significant in calculating the true position of the sun, as will be explained in the following chapter.</i> With the exception of the moon, that point in the orbit of the sun and, similarly, in the orbit of the other planets rotates in a uniform pattern, traveling about one degree in seventy years.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">9</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As the Rambam mentions in <i>Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah</i> 3:3, not only do the sun and the stars move in their orbits, the orbits themselves move in the heavens. This movement can be seen most clearly by charting the movement of the apogee, the point in the orbit furthest from the Earth. The movement of the sun's orbit and similarly, that of the other stars, is relatively slow. The moon's orbit, by contrast, is moving at a much faster pace, as mentioned in the notes on Chapter 14, Halachah 1.</i> This point is referred to as the apogee.<br>Accordingly, in ten days, the apogee of the sun travels one and a half seconds - i.e., [a second and] thirty thirds. Thus, in one hundred days, [the apogee] travels fifteen seconds. In one thousand days, it travels two minutes and thirty seconds, and in ten thousand days, 25 minutes. In twenty-nine days, it travels four seconds and a fraction. In a regular year, it travels 53 seconds.<br>As mentioned, the starting point for all our calculations is the eve of Thursday, the third of Nisan, 4938 years after creation. The position of the sun in terms of its mean distance on this date was 7 degrees, 3 minutes and 32 seconds in the constellation of Aries, in symbols 7° 3' 32\". The apogee of the sun at this starting point was 26 degrees, 45 minutes and 8 seconds in the constellation of Gemini, in symbols 26° 45' 8\".<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">10</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since more than 800 years have passed since the composition of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>, the apogee of the sun has moved approximately twelve degrees and is presently located in the constellation of Cancer.</i><br>Accordingly, if you desire to know the position of the sun according to its mean distance at any given time, you should calculate the number of days from the starting point mentioned until the particular day you desire, and determine the mean distance it traveled during these days according to the figures given previously, add the entire sum together, accumulating each unit of measure separately. The result is the mean position of the sun on that particular day. For example, if we desired to determine the mean position of the sun at the beginning of the eve of the Sabbath on the fourteenth of the month of Tammuz of the present year, the starting point [for these calculations, we should do the following]: Calculate the number of days from the starting point until the date on which you desire to know the position of the sun. [In this instance,] it is one hundred days. The mean distance the sun travels in one hundred days is 98° 33' 53\". We then add that to the starting point, which is 7° 3' 32\", and arrive at a total of 105 degrees, 37 minutes and 25 seconds, in symbols 105° 37' 25\". Thus, the sun's mean position at the beginning of this night will be 15 degrees and 37 minutes of the sixteenth degree in the constellation of Cancer.<br>At times, the sun will be located in the mean [position] that can be determined using the above methods of calculation at the beginning of the night, and at times an hour before the setting of the sun, or an hour afterwards.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since, as explained in the previous chapter, the mean distance does not represent the place where the sun can actually be seen in the sky, there will be a slight discrepancy. The mean position represents the sun's position at 6 PM. During the summer months, the sun will reach that position before sunset, and during the winter months, it will reach that position after sunset.</i> This [lack of definition concerning] the sun's [position] will not be of consequence with regard to calculating the visibility [of the moon], for we will compensate for this approximation when calculating the mean position of the moon.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">12</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the conclusion of Chapter 14.</i><br>One should follow the same procedure at all times - for any date one desires, even if it is one thousand years in the future. When [the mean distance traveled by the sun] is calculated and the remainder [after all the multiples of 360 have been subtracted] is added to [the figures of] the starting point, you will arrive at the mean position.<br>The same principles apply regarding the mean position of the moon, or the mean position of any other planet. Once you know the distance it travels in a single day, and you know the starting point from which to begin [calculations], total up the distance it travels throughout as many years or days as you desire, add that to the starting point, and you will arrive at its position according to its mean distance.<br>The same concepts apply regarding the apogee of the sun. Add to the starting point the distance it travels over the course of days or years, and you will know the position of the apogee of the sun for the day you desire.<br>Similarly, if you desire to establish another date as the starting point instead of the date which [we have chosen] to begin in this year, [choosing] a year that will be the beginning of a particular nineteen-year cycle, or that will be the beginning of a new century, you may. Similarly, if you would like to use as a starting point a date in the past, before the date given above, or a date many years in the future, the path [to arrive at such a starting point] is well known.<br>How is this figure to be calculated? We have already established the mean distance traveled by the sun in a regular year, in twenty- nine days, and in a single day. It is known that a year whose months<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., both Marcheshvan and Kislev. See Chapter 8, Halachot 6-10, for the ground rules regarding the determination of when a year is regular, when its months are full, and when they are lacking.</i> are full is one day longer than a regular year. Similarly, a year whose months are lacking is one day shorter than a regular year. With regard to a leap year,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 6, Halachah 11, which relates that seven of the years in a nineteen-year cycle are leap years, and states which of these years will be leap years.</i> if its months are regular, it will be thirty days longer than a regular year. If its months are full, it will be thirty-one days longer than a regular year. If its months are lacking, it will be twenty-nine days longer than a regular year.<br>Since these principles are already established, it is possible to calculate the mean distance traveled by the sun for as many years or as many days as you desire, and add it to [the mean position of the sun on the date established previously as] the starting point, and you will be able to determine the mean [position of the sun] for any future date. Afterwards, you can use that date as a starting point.<br>[Conversely,] you may subtract the mean [distance traveled by the sun over the course of a particular period] from [the mean position of the sun on the date established previously as] the starting point, and you will be able to determine the mean [position of the sun] for any past date. Afterwards, you can use that date as a starting point.<br>The same principles also apply with regard to the mean position of the moon or any of the other planets, if [their mean positions on any particular date] are known to you. It also should be apparent that just as it is possible to determine the mean position of the sun for any future date, so too, it is possible to determine its mean position for any previous date."

Its mean progress within this orbit is referred to as the mean within its path.<br>The small orbit [within which the moon revolves] itself rotates in a larger orbit that encompasses the earth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in Chapter 11, the rate of the advance of the sun, the moon, and the other planets does not appear to be uniform. For the sun, the deviation is relatively minor and can be resolved by postulating that the Earth is not at the center of the sun's orbit. The deviations of the moon from its mean rate of advance, however, are larger than that of the sun, and more irregular. (According to modern science, these deviations result from the gravitational pull of the sun and other celestial bodies.)<br>To resolve this difficulty, some ancient astronomers (Ptolemy and Aristotle, among others) postulated that with regard to the moon, two orbits were involved: One orbit encompassed the Earth, although the Earth was not at its center. Around this orbit existed one (and according to some opinions, more than one) smaller orbit, within which the moon rotated. This smaller orbit is referred to as an epicycle. Because of the moon's position in this smaller orbit, it would appear to be either ahead of or behind the mean position of the center of this orbit.</i> The mean progress of the small orbit within the large orbit that encompasses the earth is referred to as the moon's mean. The rate of progress for the moon's mean in one day is 13 degrees, 10 minutes and 35 seconds, in symbols 13° 10' 35\".<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This refers to the rate of progress that is apparent to an observer on the Earth. In theory, however, this figure is a result of two different motions. The entire orbit of the moon is moving in the heavens. (The orbit of the sun is also moving, as reflected in the movement of the sun's apogee, as mentioned in Chapter 12, Halachah 2. The sun's orbit is moving at a very slow pace, one and a half seconds a day. In contrast, the moon's orbit moves much faster, slightly more than 11 degrees each day. This movement is from east to west, opposite to the movement of the heavenly sphere.)<br>Within this larger orbit revolves the epicycle, the smaller orbit around which the moon revolves. The epicycle is revolving at approximately 24 1/2 degrees a day, from west to east. Thus, an observer on the Earth would see the epicycle as moving 13 degrees and a fraction (i.e., 24 1/2 - 11 1/5) forward (eastward) in the heavenly sphere every day, as the Rambam states.</i>"

            "english": "If you desire to know the true position of the moon<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">1</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the location of the moon as it appears in the sky.</i> on any particular date, first calculate the mean of the moon at the time of the sighting for the desired date. Then calculate the mean of the [moon within its] path and the sun's mean [position] for that date. Subtract the sun's mean from the moon's mean and double the remainder.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">2</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is following the notion that the Earth does not lie at the center of the moon's orbit. Hence, like the sun, the moon has an apogee and a perigee.<br>Also of significance here is the fact that, as mentioned in the notes on the previous chapter, the orbit of the moon is moving from east to west at a relatively fast pace, 11 degrees, 12 minutes and 19 seconds per day.<br>A conjunction refers to the time the sun, the moon, and the Earth are aligned in a straight line. Accordingly, the sun's rays are reflected back without being observed from the Earth, and the moon is therefore not seen in the heavens. At the time of the conjunction, the moon is always at its apogee.<br>(This can be explained as follows: When the moon is aligned directly between the sun and the Earth, it is at the point in its orbit that is closest to the sun. Therefore, the gravitational pull of the sun draws the moon away from the Earth.)<br>As the moon continues in its orbit, after the conjunction, it and its apogee move away from the sun in opposite directions. Significantly, the angular distance traveled by the moon and its apogee from the sun is the same.<br>To explain: The moon's mean is moving at rate of 13 degrees, 10 minutes and 35 seconds per day from west to east. Since the sun is also moving from west to east at the rate of 59 minutes and eight seconds per day, every day the moon will have traveled 12 degrees, 11 minutes and 27 seconds from the sun. Its apogee is moving from east to west at a speed of 11 degrees, 12 minutes and 19 seconds per day. When the sun's mean motion is added to that figure, the same total, 12 degrees, 11 minutes and 27 seconds, is reached. Thus, the double elongation, which is calculated by doubling the angular distance between the moon's mean and the sun's mean, represents the angular distance between the moon's mean and the apogee of its orbit.<br>(The moon also reaches its apogee when it is full. At this point, the sun, the Earth, and the moon are aligned in a straight line, and the gravitational pull of the sun draws the Earth away from the moon. According to contemporary science, however, these two figures are not alike, and the apogee reached at conjunction is greater than the apogee reached at a full moon.)</i> The resulting figure is referred to as the double elongation."

Thus, within five hours of the conjunction of the sun and the moon, it will be possible to sight the new moon.<br>The commentaries have noted a slight incongruity between the Rambam's statements here and his statements at the beginning of Chapter 17, where he states that the longitude at the night of the sighting of the moon will not be less than nine degrees nor more than twenty-four degrees. There is a difference of approximately seven degrees between these two figures. They attempt to resolve this discrepancy by stating that in this chapter the Rambam is speaking in terms of mean distance, while in Chapter 17 he is speaking in terms of true distance.

At the time of conjunction, the sun and the moon are at the same longitudinal point. Therefore, they set at the same time. As the difference in longitude between them increases, the crescent of the moon grows and the time of its setting becomes later, increasing the chances of its visibility.<br>Nevertheless, the moon's latitude also affects its visibility. The greater the latitude of the moon [i.e., its inclination from the orbit of the sun] the larger its crescent will appear. Also, a northerly latitude causes the moon to set later and thus makes it easier to be sighted. A southerly latitude, by contrast, causes the moon to set earlier and thus makes sighting it more difficult.</i> There are two points, one opposite the other, at which these orbits intersect.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">3</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The difference in latitude between the orbits of the sun and the moon explains why there is not a lunar eclipse at every full moon, and why there is not a solar eclipse at every conjunction - although at the time of the full moon, the sun, the earth and the moon are aligned in a single line, and at the time of conjunction, the sun, the moon and the earth are aligned in a single line.<br>Although the longitude of the sun and the moon is the same at these times, since their latitudes are different, the moon's shadow does not interfere with the light of the sun at a conjunction, and the earth's shadow does not prevent the light of the sun from reaching the moon at a full moon. Only when a conjunction or a full moon takes place at (or near) the point where the orbits of the moon and the sun intersect does an eclipse take place.</i><br>When the moon is at one of these points, it is revolving in the same plane as the sun. As the moon departs from these points, it is proceeding either to the north or to the south of the sun.<br>The point in the moon's [orbit] at which it begins to be inclined to the north of [the plane of] the sun's [orbit] is referred to as the head, while the point [in its orbit] from which it begins to be inclined to the south of [the plane of] the sun's [orbit] is referred to as the tail.*<br>This head revolves at a uniform pace,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">4</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Because of the revolution of the head, the determination of the moon's longitude will require several stages of computation.</i> [proceeding] in opposition to the movement of the sphere of the constellations<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the head revolves from east to west.</i> without increase or decrease - i.e., it moves from [the constellation of] Pisces to [the constellation of] Aquarius.

Hence, it is unlikely that the moon will be sighted.<br>When the longitude of the moon is greater, the size of the moon's crescent will increase, as will the interval between the time of its setting and that of the sun. Accordingly, the possibility of sighting the moon will increase.<br>When the longitude is significantly large, it is obvious that the moon will be seen and no other calculations are necessary. When, however, the longitude is of intermediate size, there is a question whether the moon will be seen. The resolution of this question depends on the inclination of the ecliptic and the latitude of the moon - i.e., the angle - and the direction of that angle - to which the moon is inclined from the plane of the sun.<br>[In this context, it is worthy to mention a question raised by several contemporary commentaries on <i>Hilchot Kiddush HaChodesh</i>: Seemingly, there is a direct connection between the concepts mentioned at the conclusion of Chapter 15 and those mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. Why does the Rambam interpose the discussion of the moon's latitude (the subject matter of Chapter 16, which becomes relevant only in subsequent halachot) between them?]</i>"

            "english": "Afterwards, go back and see the constellation in which the third longitude - i.e., [the amended figure representing] the distance between the sun and the moon - is located:<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam's intent in these sets of calculations is to reach a point on the equator that will set at the same time the third longitude sets in Jerusalem. For although the third longitude was able to relate the moon's position to the equator, it did not take into consideration the difference between the horizon of the equator and the horizon of Jerusalem. This is accomplished by drawing a line from the third longitude to the equator, which is parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem.</i> If it is located in the constellation of Pisces or Aries, add one sixth [of its length] to the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Two factors are significant in determining the fourth longitude: a) The angle of the constellation's inclination to the horizon of the equator. The greater the inclination of the constellation, the closer the fourth longitude will be located to the equator.<br>b) whether the constellation is inclined to the north or to the south.<br>If the constellation is inclined to the north, the third longitude, and hence the place on the equator parallel to it, will be located further away from the horizon, resulting in a later setting and thus an extended fourth longitude. Conversely, if the inclination is southerly, the third longitude will be located closer to the horizon, resulting in a shortened fourth longitude.<br>Of these two factors, the latter is more significant, and causes a larger correction. To explain these factors with regard to the constellations of Pisces and Aries: These constellations are inclined to a great degree, a factor that would reduce the fourth longitude. Since, however, they are northerly inclined, and this is the stronger factor, a modest increase is required.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Aquarius or the constellation of Taurus, add one fifth [of its length] to the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">These constellations are inclined to the north, and the degree of their inclination is less than that of Pisces and Aries. Hence, a greater increase is required.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Capricorn or the constellation of Gemini, add one sixth [of its length] to the third longitude.<br>If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Sagittarius or the constellation of Cancer, leave the third longitude as it is, without making any addition or subtraction.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">41</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here, the constellations begin a southerly inclination. Hence, although they are more parallel to the horizon of the equator, no addition is made.</i> If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Scorpio or the constellation of Leo, subtract one fifth [of its length] from the third longitude. If the [third] longitude is located in the constellation of Libra or the constellation of Virgo, subtract one third [of its length] from the third longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In this instance, the degree of inclination of these constellations is great and their inclination is southerly. Both of these factors lead to a reduction in the fourth longitude. Hence, the greatest subtraction is required.</i><br>The figure resulting from these subtractions or additions to the third longitude, or from leaving it without adjustment, is referred to as the fourth longitude.<br>[Afterwards, a further correction is necessary:] Return to the first latitude,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">43</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ralbach questions why the Rambam refers to the first latitude. Seemingly, it would be appropriate to make this correction based on the second latitude, for there is a significant difference between it and the first latitude. According to trigonometry, it also would appear that the calculations should be based on the second latitude.</i> and set aside two thirds [of its length]. This is called the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">44</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Although the fourth longitude established a relationship between the equator and Jerusalem, it is still dependent on the third longitude, which relates to the moon and the celestial sphere as they set on the horizon of the equator. Through the correction mentioned here, we find a place on the extension of the equator that will set at the same as the moon sets in Jerusalem. Having reached this point, we can calculate the difference in time (15 degrees to the hour) between the setting of the sun and this point (which will set at the same time as the setting of the moon). Accordingly, we will be able to determine whether or not this interval will allow for the sighting of the moon.<br>The correction for geographic longitude is reached by drawing a line from the position of the moon parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem. One might ask: If this was the Rambam's intent, why were so many intermediate steps - the definition of the second, third, and fourth latitudes - necessary? Why didn't he suggest drawing the above- mentioned line at the very beginning of his calculations?<br>The explanation is that the Rambam allowed an individual to follow his own steps in arriving at this final figure. I.e., these lines and distances are all artificial and can be determined only by calculations. Through trigonometry, if one knows the length of one side of a triangle and two angles, or the length of two sides and one angle, it is possible to calculate the size of all three angles and all three sides. To find the line extending from the moon to the equator parallel to the horizon of Jerusalem, the Rambam had to build sets of triangles, and calculate angles based on the relationship of one triangle to another. The process he followed is reflected in the series of corrections he offers.</i><br>Consider whether the latitude of the moon is northerly. If so, add the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude to the fourth longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">45</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A northerly latitude means that the actual position of the moon is further removed from the horizon than the third longitude. This will result in a later setting of the moon. Accordingly, the correction based on geographic latitude will require addition to the fourth longitude. This applies regardless of whether the inclination of the constellation in which the moon is located is northerly or southerly.</i> If the latitude of the moon is southerly, subtract the correction [resulting from geographic] latitude from the fourth longitude.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">46</sup><i class=\"footnote\">A southerly latitude means that the actual position of the moon is closer to the horizon than the third longitude. This will result in an earlier setting of the moon. Accordingly, the correction based on geographic latitude will require subtraction from the fourth longitude. This applies regardless of whether the inclination of the constellation in which the moon is located is northerly or southerly.</i> The figure resulting from these subtractions or additions to the fourth longitude is referred to as the arc of sighting."

There is no contradiction between those statements and the statements above; the difference is in the definition of the word \"inclined.\" In the present context, the Rambam is using the word \"inclined\" to refer to the position of the ecliptic as it passes through these constellations: Is it located above or below the equator, and what is the extent of its variance from the equator?<br>Previously, we had used the word \"inclined\" to refer to the direction of the path of movement of the stars in the sky.
