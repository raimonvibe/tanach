Instead, he is made liable by the testimony of witnesses.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a principle that applies not only with regard to the fine in question, but with regard to all <i>k'nasot</i> levied by the Torah. To explain: There are two types of monetary penalties levied by the Torah: a) <i>nezek</i>, damages - i.e., compensation for personal injury and/or loss of property - and <i>k'nas</i>, a fine, payment required by the Torah over and above what a person would be held liable for damages.<br>Although a person is liable for <i>nezek</i> when he makes an admission of guilt, he is not held liable for a <i>k'nas</i> unless his guilt is established by witnesses. (See <i>Hilchot Nizkei Mammon</i> 2:8 and <i>Hilchot Geneivah</i> 3:7.) Moreover, even if he admits his guilt and then witnesses come, he is not liable for payment of the <i>k'nas</i>.</i> Therefore, [if a man] says: \"I raped or seduced the daughter of so and so,\" he is not liable to pay a fine. He must, however, make restitution for the embarrassment and the damages [he caused].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As mentioned in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>, the Rambam's statements here are in direct contradiction to his statements in <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i> 5:6, where he states that when a person admits injuring a colleague, but there are no witnesses who testify to the matter, he is not liable for the damages and the pain, but is liable for the injured's unemployment, embarrassment and medical treatment. (As reflected by the commentaries on <i>Hilchot Chovel UMazik</i>, this ruling is contested by many authorities.)<br>The Rambam's descendant, Rav Yehoshua, attempts to reconcile the Rambam's rulings, explaining that the laws governing the injuries suffered by a raped or seduced maiden differ from those governing other types of injury.</i><br>Similarly, when a maiden files a legal claim against a man, saying \"You raped me,\" or \"You seduced me,\" and he denies the matter entirely, he is required to take a Rabbinic oath<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">More precisely, the term used is <i>sh'vuat hesset</i>, a Rabbinic oath of lesser severity. See <i>Hilchot Sh'vuot</i> 11:13 and <i>Hilchot To'en V'Nit'an</i> 1:3.</i> to support his claim, for if he admits his culpability, he would be liable for the embarrassment, the damages and the pain.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">18</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is emphasizing that if the only issue were the <i>k'nas</i>, the man would not be held liable for an oath, because this oath was instituted to encourage the defendant to admit his guilt. With regard to the <i>k'nas</i>, this admission would be of no significance, because his liability is dependent only on the testimony of witnesses. Nevertheless, since there is also a claim for damages, and on that matter his admission would make him liable, he is required to take an oath.</i>"

Hence, the situation resembles the case (<i>Sh'vuot</i> 38b) where a person claims \"You owe my father 100 <i>zuzim</i>,\" and the defendant states, \"I owe him only 50,\" in which instance the defendant is not required to take an oath, because the person making the claim is not the one to whom the money is paid.<br>It is possible, the Ra'avad continues, for the father to make a definite claim that his daughter was raped.

That a person should come to court and say: \"I engaged in marital relations with this maiden,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">15</sup><i class=\"footnote\">There is a difference of opinion among our Sages whether or not all the following laws apply if the husband did not engage in marital relations with his wife. The Rambam follows the opinion that it is necessary for the couple to have engaged in marital relations. See the gloss of the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> on Halachah 12.</i> and I discovered that she was not a virgin. I investigated the matter and determined that she committed adultery after I had consecrated her.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the husband's claim is twofold: a) that contrary to his supposition, his bride was not a virgin; b) that she had committed adultery between the time he consecrated her, and the time he consummated the marriage. The latter dimension of the claim is more significant, because if substantiated, it involves the death penalty. The issue of a groom's claim that a bride presumed to be a virgin was not - without any knowledge of an adulterous relationship - is discussed in <i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 11:8-17. See Halachah 11.</i> These are the witnesses in whose presence she committed adultery.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">17</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For no punishment will be administered by the court unless two witnesses testify to the wrongdoing.</i><br>The court then listens to the words of the witnesses and examines their testimony.

It refers to witnesses who testify that it was impossible for the husband's witnesses to testify with regard to the alleged adultery, because the two witnesses were together in a different place at the time the first witnesses testified that the adultery took place. If the second pair of witnesses state that they were in the same place as the first pair and did not witness the commission of adultery, the testimony of the first pair is nullified, but the first pair of witnesses is not punished. This is referred to as <i>hakashah</i>. See <i>Hilchot Edut</i>, Chapter 18.</i> and it is determined that they testified falsely, [the witnesses] should be executed by stoning,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">20</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As stated in Deuteronomy 19:19, when the testimony of witnesses is nullified in the above fashion, the lying witnesses are giving the punishment they desired to have imposed upon the defendant.</i> [the husband] should be flogged, and he should pay 100 <i>sela'im</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Note the <i>Minchat Chinuch</i> (Mitzvah 553), who quotes opinions that maintain that if the girl's father brings witnesses who nullify the husband's witnesses through <i>hakashah</i>, the husband's witnesses are not punished, but the husband himself is required to pay the fine.</i><br>This is what is meant by [Deuteronomy 22:17]: \"This is [evidence of] my daughter's virginity\" - i.e., these are the witnesses who nullify [the testimony] of the husband's witnesses.<br>If the husband brings other witnesses who nullify [the testimony]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Here again the intent is <i>hazamah</i>.</i> of the father's witnesses, the maiden and the father's witness should be executed by stoning.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moreover, the witnesses must pay a fine of 100 <i>sela'im</i> to the husband.</i> This is what is meant by [Deuteronomy 22:20]: \"If the [accusation] is true.\" According to the Oral Tradition, the passage speaks of witnesses who nullify the testimony of other witnesses, and a third pair who nullify the testimony of the second pair."
