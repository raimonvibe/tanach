If the watchman guarded the animal in an inferior manner, he is not held liable if he is an unpaid watchman. Instead, the owners are liable, even if the animal kills a human being. The watchman is held liable if he is a paid watchman, a renter or a borrower.In his Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 396:8), Rav Yosef Karo quotes the interpretation of the Maggid Mishneh.

From this halachah, by contrast, it appears that the lien remains.In resolution, the Chatam Sofer makes a distinction between the sanctification of the value of the ox (as in this halachah), in which instance the lien remains, and the sanctification of the body of the ox (as in Halachah 4), in which instance the lien is nullified.</i> [If the owner] slaughters the ox, [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from the meat.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> The Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 407:2) state that if the slaughter causes the value of the ox to depreciate, the owner must reimburse the person whose property was damaged for the loss.</i> [If the owner] gives it away as a present, [the present] is binding,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> And therefore the recipient of the present may work with the animal.</i> but [the person whose property was damaged] may collect his due from [the animal]."

The person whose oxen were damaged claims: the large ox damaged the large ox, and the small ox damaged the small ox.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This difference is significant if the oxen that caused the damage are tamim, for then the payment is expropriated from the body of the ox, and it is possible that the value of the small ox that caused the damage will be less than that of the large ox that was damaged.</i> The person whose oxen caused the damage, by contrast claims: \"No. It was the small ox that damaged the large one, and the large ox that damaged the small one.\" [A similar dispute arises if] one [of the oxen that caused the damage] was <i>mu'ad</i> and the other <i>tam</i>. The person whose oxen were damaged claims: the ox that was <i>mu'ad</i> damaged the large ox, and the ox that was <i>tam</i> damaged the small ox.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This difference is significant, because when an ox is mu'ad, its owner is responsible for the entire amount of the damages, while when it is tam, only half the damages are required. Needless to say, the full value of the large ox is far more than the full value of the small ox.</i> By contrast, the person whose oxen caused the damage claims: \"It was the ox that was <i>tam</i> that damaged the large one, and the ox that was <i>mu'ad</i> that damaged the small one.\" [In both these instances,] the burden of proof is upon the one who wishes to exact payment. If there is no proof,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> If, however, witnesses observed that the oxen belonging to the same owner caused the damage, but were not able to identify which one caused the damage, the owner is obligated to pay the amount he admits, as in the previous halachah (Maggid Mishneh).</i> the one who caused the damage is not liable [at all]. To what can this be compared? To an instance where a person claims that a colleague owes him wheat, and the colleague admits to owing him barley. In such a case, [the defendant] is required to take a Rabbinic oath and then is not liable, even for the barley, as will be explained in <i>Hilchot To'en</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Chapter 3, Halachah 10. The rationale is that with regard to the instance when one ox is mu'ad, the defendant does not accept any liability with regard to the claim that the plaintiff makes, and the plaintiff has not made a claim regarding the sum the defendant admits liability for; therefore, the defendant is not held liable.With regard to the instance where both of the oxen are tamim, the defendant is not liable, because payment of half the damages is considered a fine, and a person who admits culpability for a fine is not liable (Maggid Mishneh).</i>If the person whose oxen were damaged seizes possession [of property belonging to the person whose oxen caused the damage], he may take payment for the damages to the small ox from the body of the large ox and may take payment for the damages to the large ox from the body of the small ox, as the person who caused the damages admitted.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Even the Tur and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 400:3), who view this situation more stringently than the Rambam, accept this principle. Moreover, according to their logic (see Choshen Mishpat 399:3), if there are no witnesses that the plaintiff seized possession of the property of the defendant, the plaintiff may keep an amount equal to his own claim.The above applies only when the plaintiff seizes possession of the defendant's property before taking the matter to court. If, however, he took the matter to court, and the court ruled in favor of the defendant, as the Rambam states, and then the plaintiff seizes the defendant's property, he must return it.</i> If he did not seize possession [of such property], however, no money at all is expropriated from the person whose oxen caused the damage."

[We must say that it was captured, because] the owners are not obligated to pay an atonement fine unless the ox is executed.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> There are exceptions to this principle, as reflected in Halachot 9 and 10.</i> It mortally wounded three individuals at the same time [and they and the fourth person the ox gored all died at the time]. It killed three animals.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> In Chapter 6, Halachah 8, the Rambam states that an ox that is mu'ad with regard to a human is not mu'ad with regard to an animal. From that, we can derive that an animal that is mu'ad with regard to an animal is not mu'ad with regard to a human.This does not necessarily represent a contradiction to this halachah. For there, the Rambam is speaking about causing damage, and here we are speaking about causing death (Kessef Mishneh).</i> In all these instances, it is deemed as<i> mu'ad </i>to kill, and the owner is liable to pay an atonement fine. There is also another instance. On three occasions [one of the oxen belonging to a person killed a human]; on each of these occasions, the witnesses recognized the owner, but did not recognize the ox. On the fourth occasion, they saw an ox that killed a person [and were able to recognize it afterwards]. They did not, however, know if this was the same ox that had killed [people] on the three previous occasions or not.[In this instance, the owner of the ox is liable to pay an atonement fine. The rationale is that] since the owner was warned that he had an ox in his herd that had killed [people] on three occasions, he should have guarded all his oxen [more carefully]. Since he did not, he must pay the atonement fine."

As the Maggid Mishneh explains, according to the first of the opinions mentioned in that passage, it appears that what is significant is whether the animal died because of the blow it received or because of the foul air in the cistern, while according to the second opinion, what is significant is the side from which the animal fell.The Kessef Mishneh reconciles the Rambam's interpretation, explaining that the Rambam did not see the two interpretations as being contradictory, for if that were the case, each one could be refuted by an obvious question. According to the first opinion: Why would the first person be held liable if the ox died because of the air in the cistern if the ox fell in from the side that the other person widened? Had he not widened it, the ox might not have fallen in.According to the second opinion, the question arises: Since the second person's action makes him liable if an ox falls in, what difference does it make from which side it fell.For these reasons, the Rambam maintains that the two opinions are complementary. See the D'rishah (Choshen Mishpat 410), which offers an alternate resolution of the Rambam's view. Rabbenu Asher, the Tur, and the Ramah (Choshen Mishpat 410:16) differ with the Rambam and follow the second opinion, which maintains that the liability depends on the side from which the ox fell.</i>"

First of all, the Talmud explains that this matter is dependent on a difference of opinion between Rav and Shmuel. In Halachah 15, the Rambam rules according to Shmuel, while here his ruling appears closer to that of Rav. According to the Ra'avad, if the animal fell backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not held liable, but if the owner seizes property belonging to the other, it is not expropriated from him.The Rambam's interpretation of this passage is obviously problematic. In his Commentary on the Mishnah (Bava Kama 5:6), his interpretation also appears to differ from this halachah. There he writes that if the ox falls backwards into the cistern, the owner of the cistern is liable. If he falls backwards outside the cistern, the owner of the cistern is not liable. This understanding is reflected in the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31).</i> If [the animal] fell forward outside the cistern because of the sound of the digging and died, the court does not hold the owner of the cistern liable.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">55</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> For the animal died because of the blow it received from the land in the public domain, and not that of the cistern. The Ra'avad differs with regard to this clause as well and maintains that the property of the cistern's owner may not be seized. The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat 410:31) also follows that understanding.</i> If the person [whose ox died] seizes property [belonging to the owner of the cistern], it is not expropriated from him. If [the animal] fell backward outside the cistern and died or was injured, the owner of the cistern is not liable."

The Maggid Mishneh justifies the Rambam's ruling, citing several interpretations by the Sages in Bava Kama 60a. He nevertheless questions the Rambam's decision here, based on the Rambam's own words in Hilchot Sh'chenim 11:1-2.The Kessef Mishneh resolves this difficulty, explaining that in Hilchot Sh'chenim, the Rambam mentions a situation in which a person winnows grain in his own domain, but the wind carries the chaff outside his domain. There, even though an ordinary wind is involved, the person is not held liable. This appears to contradict the ruling here. Nevertheless, as the Rambam himself states in Hilchot Sh'chenim, had it not been for the wind, the chaff would never have caused damaged. In this instance, the person's fanning of the fire would have caused it to spread sufficiently to cause damage.</i> And whenever a person's [actions] cause damage, he is liable to pay for the full amount of the damages from the choicest property he owns, as if the damage was inflicted directly."

Although fire is one of a person's possessions, it is as if he caused him damage with his arrows.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> This is the subject of a difference of opinion among our Sages (Bava Kama 22a). Rabbi Yochanan maintains, as the Rambam rules, that kindling a fire is regarded like shooting an arrow. Resh Lakish differs and maintains that a fire is regarded no differently from a person's cistern or his animals. To explain Rabbi Yochanan's opinion: When a person shoots an arrow, he is considered to have caused damage with his person although the damage took place far from him. So too, when he kindles a fire, despite the fact that the damage occurs in a distant place, it is as if he caused the damage with his person. Note the Maggid Mishneh, who points to an apparent contradiction in the Rambam's rulings. For Rabbi Yochanan does not free a person of liability for articles that are buried. It is, however, possible to explain that the Rambam does not accept Rabbi Yochanan's perspective blindly. He accepts it in this instance, but follows the other interpretations with regard to buried property.</i> If, by contrast, injury to a man is caused by a person's animal or cistern, he is liable for the damages alone, as we have explained.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\"> Chapter 11, Halachah 6, and Chapter 13, Halachah 2.</i>"
