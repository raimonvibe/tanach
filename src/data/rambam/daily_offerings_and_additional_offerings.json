Perhaps <i>hatavah</i> can refer only to the rekindling of the lamps in the morning as indicated by the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah cited above.

Instead, the simple meaning of his words is that the breads were baked as elongated rectangles and folded over only when they were put on the table itself. The folds lay on top of the bread rather than standing perpendicular to it. This form could still be considered \"as an open drawer,\" because of the space between the two folds.</i> Similarly, he should place one loaf on another loaf until he arranged six loaves.

Since the fowl is a sin-offering, it is given precedence.</i> A sin-offering takes precedence over a guilt-offering, because its blood is applied to the four corners [of the altar] and on its base.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">32</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See the description of the presentation of the blood of a sin-offering in <i>Hilchot Ma'aseh HaKorbanot</i> 5:7. There are, by contrast, only two presentations of the blood of a guilt-offering on the altar (<i>ibid.</i> :6). Hence the sin-offering is given precedence.</i> All of the sin-offerings mentioned in the Torah take precedence over all of the guilt-offerings with the exception of the guilt-offering brought by a person afflicted by <i>tzaraat</i>, because it comes to make a person fit.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">33</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As explained in the Rambam's Commentary to the Mishnah (<i>Zevachim</i> 10:5), this sacrifice enables the person to regain his ritual purity. Afterwards, he may enter the Temple Courtyard and partake of sacrificial foods. The order of the sacrifices brought by a person after being healed from a <i>tzara'at</i> affliction is described in <i>Hilchot Mechusrei Kapparah</i> 4:2.</i><br>A guilt-offering takes precedence over a thanksgiving-offering and the ram brought by a nazirite, because it is a sacrifice of the most sacred order.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">34</sup><i class=\"footnote\">While the latter two are considered as sacrifices of lesser sanctity.</i> A thanksgiving-offering and the ram brought by a nazirite take precedence over a peace-offering, because they may be eaten for only one day and require that bread bey brought with them.
