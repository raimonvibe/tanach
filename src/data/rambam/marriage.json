This classification does not, however, in any way diminish the status of this practice, and it is as if it were explicitly stated in the Torah. Thus, a marriage bond formalized through the transfer of money has the same status as one formalized through either of the other means mentioned by the Rambam.<br>Rav Kapach differs and states that the Rambam altered the text in his later years, and the correct version states, \"All three are from the Torah.\" In explanation, he draws attention to the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Kiddushin</i> 1:1) and to one of the Rambam's responsa, and on this basis differs with the above principle.<br>He maintains that whenever the Rambam uses the expression <i>midivrei soferim</i>, he means that the practice is Rabbinic in origin and does not have the status of Torah law. The only practices that are considered to be ordained by the Torah are those explicitly stated in the Torah or mentioned by the Sages as having the status of Torah law.<br>In this context, he explains the Rambam's approach. Originally [as evidenced by the Rambam's statements in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> (Positive Commandment 213)], the Rambam thought that sexual relations are the only <i>kiddushin</i> that are effective according to the Torah. For not only the effectiveness of the transfer of money, but also that of the transfer of a legal document is derived by the Sages only through Biblical exegesis. Afterwards, on the basis of certain passages that state that the effectiveness of the transfer of a legal document has the status of a Torah practice, the Rambam changed his opinion and wrote that the transfer of a document is also effective according to the Torah. This opinion is reflected in the Commentary on the Mishnah and the original version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>. Even later, the Rambam accepted the opinion that the effectiveness of the transfer of money also stems from the Torah itself. This is reflected in Chapter 3, Halachah 20, and the corrected text mentioned above.<br>(See <i>Birkat Avraham</i>, Responsum 44, in which the Rambam's son, Rabbenu Avraham, substantiates Rav Kapach's version of the <i>Mishneh Torah</i>.)</i><br>This process of acquisition is universally referred to as <i>erusin</i> (\"betrothal\") or <i>kiddushin</i> (\"consecration\"). And a woman who is acquired in any of these three ways is referred to as <i>mekudeshet</i> or <i>me'ureset</i>."

With regard to a financial claim, no witnesses are necessary if both litigants agree regarding a matter.<br>As stated in this halachah, this concept does not apply with regard to the laws of marriage and divorce. Two rationales are given for this matter:<br>a) When the man and woman agree with regard to the establishment of a marriage bond, they are limiting the privileges of others, for they are unable to consecrate the woman. With regard to financial matters, by contrast, the rights of others are not restricted (Rashba).<br>b) There is a fundamental difference between the function of witnesses in cases involving financial matters and their function with regard to wedding and divorce. With regard to financial matters, the function of witnesses is to clarify the truth (<i>eidei berur</i>). With regard to marriage and divorce, by contrast, the witnesses' function is to notarize the event (<i>eidei kiyyum</i>). For a marriage bond to be established - or broken - even when the husband and wife agree that the event took place, witnesses must observe the proceedings (<i>Tumim</i> 90:14, <i>Tzaphnat Paneach, Kallei HaTorah</i>).</i> Surely this applies when [a man] consecrates [a woman] without any witnesses at all [observing the act].<br>When [a man] consecrates [a woman] in the presence of individuals who are disqualified from serving as witnesses by Scriptural law, she is not consecrated.

For the fact that a woman needs a <i>get</i> to marry another person appears to indicate that according to Scriptural law, the <i>kiddushin</i> are effective.</i> or in the presence of witnesses regarding whom there is doubt whether or not they are acceptable according to Scriptural law, [the following rules apply:] If he desires to consummate the marriage, he should consecrate the woman again in the presence of acceptable witnesses.

Rav Yosef Karo (in the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i>) differs and explains that the example given by the Rambam specifies the scope of the ruling. Only when a Rabbinic commandment has its source in a prohibition from the Torah are the <i>kiddushin</i> of no effect.<br>From the Rambam's Commentary on the Mishnah (<i>Pesachim</i> 2:1), his view is clearly that even if the prohibition is entirely Rabbinic in origin, the <i>kiddushin</i> are not binding.<br>In the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 28:21), Rav Yosef Karo follows the opinion of Rabbenu Asher, who states that if the article is forbidden by force of Rabbinic decree, and that prohibition has no source in the Torah, the <i>kiddushin</i> are binding. If the prohibition has its source in the Torah, the status of the <i>kiddushin</i> is in doubt.<br>(The rationale for this ruling is that since, according to Scriptural law, the article is worth money, and the woman accepts it as <i>kiddushin</i>, the criteria for <i>kiddushin</i> have been met.)<br>The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 28:52 justifies the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> interpretation of the Rambam's view, explaining that since in practice the article is worthless because of the Rabbinic decree, the woman has not been given an article of value, and the <i>kiddushin</i> are not binding. In support, he cites another example: The man must own the article he gives as <i>kiddushin</i>. If he acquired that article through a <i>kinyan</i> (contractual act) that is Rabbinic in origin and is not accepted by Scriptural law, the <i>kiddushin</i> are binding.<br><i>Kin'at Eliyahu</i> explains that the difference between these two views can be explained using the concepts of <i>cheftza</i> (the article) and <i>gavra</i> (the person). The Rambam's perspective puts the emphasis on the person, the woman receiving the <i>kiddushin</i>. She must receive an object from which she can derive benefit. Hence, since the Rabbis forbade deriving benefit from such an object, the <i>kiddushin</i> are not binding.<br>Rabbenu Asher, by contrast, puts the emphasis on the article given as <i>kiddushin</i>. For <i>kiddushin</i> to be effective, an article that is worth a <i>p'rutah</i> must be given. Since according to Scriptural law the article has intrinsic worth, the fact that our Sages forbade using it is not relevant in this context.</i> - e.g., <i>chametz</i> during the sixth hour on the fourteenth of Nisan."

The expression \"like interest\" implies that it is not actually considered to be taking interest, as forbidden by Scriptural law.</i> My teachers interpreted the expression \"the benefit [derived from] a loan,\" in a way that is not worthy of mention.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">21</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Rambam is referring to Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, who interprets the passage from <i>Kiddushin</i> 6b as referring to a person who extends the length of a loan at the time that payment is due. The Rambam does not accept that interpretation, because it is not logical that extending the length of the loan would be more effective than forfeiting the debt entirely (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).<br>Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi's view is also followed by Rashi and the Ra'avad. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 28:9) quotes the Rambam's interpretation (for even the opinions that differ agree that such <i>kiddushin</i> are binding). In the law that follows, it also quotes the opinion of Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi. Although the opinion of the Rambam is mentioned, the other view is favored. The Ramah, however, considers the status of the <i>kiddushin</i> to be doubtful because of the Rambam's view.</i>"

He states that in the wording of the person making the stipulation, the stipulation must be stated before the result of its completion: e.g., \"If you give me 200 <i>zuz</i>, you will be consecrated..., and if you do not give me that sum, you will not be consecrated.\" The <i>Beit Shmuel</i> 38:2 accepts the Ra'avad's interpretation and not that of the Rambam.</i><br>d) the stipulation must be something that is possible to comply with.<br>If one of these rules was not kept when a conditional agreement was made, the stipulation is nullified; it is as if there is no condition at all.

[This law applies] even when he nullifies the condition in the presence of his intended bride alone, without this being observed by witnesses. Similarly, if the woman was the one who attached a condition to the <i>kiddushin</i>, and afterwards nullified it in the presence of her prospective husband alone, the condition is of no consequence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling, maintaining that the nullification of the condition must also be made in the presence of witnesses. (He does, however, accept the Rambam's decision that if a man brings the woman to the <i>chuppah</i>, without a condition, in the presence of witnesses, the condition is considered to be nullified. For his act is considered equivalent to nullifying the condition.)<br>The Rashba accepts the Rambam's ruling with regard to conditions involving money - e.g., \"Behold, you are consecrated on condition that you give me 200 <i>zuz</i>.\" For a person may waive a debt owed him, and consider it as received. With regard to other conditions - e.g., \"Behold, you are consecrated on condition that you are not bound by vows\" - he does not accept the Rambam's position. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 38:35) quotes the Rambam's ruling.</i><br>Therefore, if [a man] consecrated [a woman] and attached a condition [to the <i>kiddushin</i>], and afterwards, brought her [to the <i>chuppah</i>] without mentioning the condition, or engaged in sexual relations with her without mentioning the condition, she must receive a divorce [before she marries another man]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">39</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the status of the <i>kiddushin</i> originally given is doubtful. If the couple want to continue living together, they must establish <i>kiddushin</i> that are unquestionably binding. And if a second man consecrates her, she must receive a divorce from both men before marrying a third (Ramah, <i>Even HaEzer</i> 38:35).</i> even though the condition was never fulfilled. [The rationale is that] perhaps [the man] nullified the condition when he brought her [to the <i>chuppah</i>] or when he engaged in sexual relations with her.<br>Similarly, when [a man] consecrates a woman with [an article] worth less than a <i>p'rutah</i> or with a loan, and then engages in sexual relations [with this woman] in the presence of witnesses, without making a statement of intent, the woman must receive a divorce [before she marries another man]. [The rationale is that] perhaps [the man intended to consecrate her through these relations] and relied on them, rather than on the <i>kiddushin</i> that are inadequate.<br>[The principle on which these rulings depend is:] It is an accepted presumption that no virtuous Jewish man will enter into sexual relations that are wanton when he has the potential to engage in these relations in a way that is a mitzvah.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">40</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In one of his responsa, the Rambam states that this principle cannot be extended without limit. When a man and a woman engage in sexual relations with a promiscuous intent, we do not say that he intends to consecrate her with these relations. The principle stated above is applied only when there is reason to presume that the man desired to establish a marriage relationship. (See also <i>Hilchot Gerushin</i> 10:19.)</i>"

If merely <i>kiddushin</i> were given, he is not under such an obligation. It is only when he wrote the woman a <i>ketubah</i> and gave it together with the <i>kiddushin</i>, that he is obligated.<br>This, however, raises a question: If he wrote the woman a <i>ketubah</i>, how can he deny the <i>kiddushin</i>? The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that this law applies only in a place where it is customary to write the <i>ketubah</i> before the <i>kiddushin</i> are given. Because in most instances there is no obligation to give a <i>ketubah</i> after <i>kiddushin</i>, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> does not mention this law at all (<i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 48:2).</i>"

It is not until <i>nisu'in,</i> however, that the couple begins living together as man and wife. At present, <i>nisu'in</i> follows directly after <i>erusin</i>; under the wedding canopy the groom consecrates the bride, and afterwards they go to a private room.</i><br>When a man has relations with his <i>arusah</i> for the sake of [establishing] <i>nisu'in</i> after he has consecrated her, the relationship is established at the beginning of sexual relations. This causes her to be considered his wife with regard to all matters.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">5</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., all the privileges and obligations of the <i>ketubah</i> (marriage contract) apply.

The claim for which the husband is required to take an oath involves a liability for which landed property is under lien. In such instances, a Torah oath is never administered. The <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 96) and others, therefore, maintain that a rabbinic oath (<i>sh'vuat hesset</i>) is administered.<br>The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> explains that the Rambam is referring to an instance in his time, when, as stated in Halachot 8-9, the lien of the <i>ketubah</i> applies to movable as well as landed property. Nevertheless, the <i>Maggid Mishneh's</i> explanation is challenged by other authorities, and even the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> himself raises questions. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 96:16) mentions both opinions.</i> for he has acknowledged a portion of a claim.<br>[In cases of this nature,] testimony is accepted [from a person]<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">56</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As in all cases of Torah law, the testimony of two witnesses is required in this instance. The <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that according to the Rambam, both of these witnesses may have witnessed the events under consideration when they were minors. In both the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> and in the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), Rav Yosef Karo differs and states that it is acceptable if one of these witnesses observed the events as a minor, but the other must have been past majority at that time.</i> once he became an adult, who says: \"I remember that when I was a child, the rites performed for virgin brides were performed on behalf of such and such.\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">57</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Generally, a witness's testimony is not accepted unless he is past majority - not only at the time he testifies in court, but also at the time he sees the event under discussion. In this instance, however, leniency is granted, because we rely on the fact that, by and large, most women are virgins when they marry. Moreover, the obligation of the <i>ketubah</i> is a point of Rabbinic law (<i>Ketubot</i> 28a; <i>Hilchot Edut</i> 14:3).</i><br>As mentioned, all the above applies [only] in places where it is customary not to compose a document recording the <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For if a <i>ketubah</i> was composed, the text of the <i>ketubah</i> will clarify the matter.

(See also <i>Hilchot Nachalot</i> 7:2.)</i> One of the conditions of the <i>ketubah</i> is that if a woman remarries after the death of her husband, she is entitled to collect the entire sum written in her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>Therefore, if she came to the court and said: \"My husband died. Grant me permission to remarry,\" without mentioning [the collection of the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> at all, she is granted permission to remarry. [Afterwards,] she is required to take an oath,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">72</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the oath made by all widows before collecting the money due them by virtue of their <i>ketubah</i> (<i>Maggid Mishneh; Kessef Mishneh</i>), in contrast to the opinion of the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 100), who requires the woman to take an oath that her husband died. (See <i>Chelkat Mechokek</i> 17:83.)</i> and then she is given [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<br>If she says, \"My husband died. Give me the money due me by virtue of my <i>ketubah</i>,\" [not only is she not granted this money,] she is not even permitted to remarry. [We assume that] she came [only] because of the matter of the <i>ketubah</i>. Our presumption is that her husband has not died. Her intent is not to remarry, but merely to collect [the money due her by virtue of] the <i>ketubah</i> during [her husband's] lifetime.<br>If she came and said: \"My husband died. Grant me permission to remarry and give me [the money due me by virtue of] my <i>ketubah</i>,\" she is permitted to remarry and is granted [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>. The rationale is that her primary intent is remarriage. If, however, she comes and says: \"My husband died. Give me [the money due me by virtue of] my <i>ketubah</i>, and grant me permission to remarry,\" she is permitted to remarry, but she is not granted [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i>.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">73</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This is a question that is left unresolved by the Talmud (<i>Yevamot</i> 117a). The Rambam rules that since the matter is very severe - if the woman remarries, and it is discovered that she lied, she will be prohibited to remain married to both her first or second husbands, and her children from her second husband will be considered illegitimate - and if her first husband is alive, it is likely that the fact will be discovered - in theory, the woman should be allowed to remarry. Because she mentions her <i>ketubah</i>, however, there is a doubt, and because of the doubt, the money in question is allowed to remain in the hands of the party in whose possession it is at the time the question is raised - i.e., the heirs. That doubt, however, applies only to the financial dimension of the relationship, and not to the permission to remarry (<i>Kessef Mishneh</i>).<br>Rabbenu Asher differs and maintains that the doubt raised by the Talmud also applies with regard to the woman's permission to remarry. Both opinions are mentioned by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 17:44), although it appears that the Rambam's approach is favored.</i> If, however, she seizes possession [of this sum], the court should not expropriate it from her possession."

The woman must take this oath for the other widows, stating that she did not collect any money from their husband's estate previously.

If his holdings are sufficiently valuable to provide only the wife with the <i>ketubah</i> of the least value, or if they are less valuable than that, all of his wives divide [his holdings] equally.<br>If his holdings are more valuable than that, they should be divided equally to provide the wife with [the money due her by virtue of] the <i>ketubah</i> of the least value. Afterwards, the remainder is divided among the remaining wives according to the same pattern.<br>What is implied? [To explain by example:] A man was married to four wives. The <i>ketubah</i> of the first was for 400 [<i>zuz</i>], that of the second for 300, that of the third for 200, and that of the forth for 100. The total sum is thus 1000 [<i>zuz</i>]. [The following rules apply] if he divorces all of them or dies. If his holdings are worth 400 [<i>zuz</i>] or less, they divide his holdings equally, and each receives 100 or less. If his holdings are worth 800 [it would be improper to divide them equally]. For if they were divided equally, the fourth wife would receive 200 [<i>zuz</i>], and [the money due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> is only 100.<br>What is done instead? 400 [<i>zuz</i>] are set aside and divided equally, each receiving 100. Thus, the fourth wife has received [the full amount due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> and she withdraws [from the suit]. Thus, 400 [<i>zuz</i>] are left for three wives, each of whom has already received 100 <i>zuz</i>]. If the 400 were divided equally among the three of them [it would be unfair]. For the third wife would receive 233 and [the amount due her by virtue of] her <i>ketubah</i> was only 200. Therefore, 300 [<i>zuz</i>] are separated from the 400, and these are divided equally among the three. Thus, the third wife receives her 200 and withdraws [from the suit]. There remain two wives and 100 <i>[zuz]</i>. This sum is divided equally between the first and second wife. Thus, the first and second wife each received 250 <i>zuz</i>; the third wife received 200; and the fourth wife, 100. This pattern of allocation is followed even when there are 100 [wives].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">11</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This pattern is also followed in the allocation of a person's holdings when they are not sufficient to pay the debts he owes, as explained in <i>Hilchot Malveh V'Loveh</i>, Chapter 20. The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam's approach and follows the minority view that the Rambam cites in that source, which maintains that the money should be divided proportionately. The Rambam's view is followed by most other <i>Rishonim</i> (Rashi, Rabbenu Yitzchak Alfasi, the Rashba and Rabbenu Asher) and is accepted by the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 96:18).</i>"

Even a contractual act, which in other contexts serves as an indication of seriousness of purpose, is not sufficient in this instance.<br>The Ra'avad and the <i>Tur</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102) differ, and maintain that if a guarantor affirms his commitment with a contractual act, he is liable. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102:6) quotes the Rambam's view, while the Ramah cites that of the Ra'avad.</i> [The rationale is that] his [intent is to] perform a mitzvah,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">13</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., he brought about the marriage between the couple.</i> and he did not cause the woman to lose anything.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">14</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As can be deduced from the Rambam's wording, the <i>Maggid Mishneh</i> states that if a person guarantees a woman's <i>nedunyah</i> (the goods she brought to the household), his commitment is binding.

The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 102:6) follows the Rambam's view, while the Ramah cites that of the Ra'avad.</i> he is obligated to pay. For a father will make a binding commitment on behalf of his son and decide to obligate himself.<br>A person who underwrites a <i>ketubah</i>, by contrast, is obligated to pay, even though he did not affirm his commitment with a contractual act. What is meant by a person who underwrites a <i>ketubah</i>? One who tells a woman: \"Marry this man. I will give [the money for] this <i>ketubah</i>.\" If, however, he says: \"I will guarantee this <i>ketubah</i>,\" \"I will pay this <i>ketubah</i>,\" \"I am obligated for it\" or the like, he is not liable unless he is the father [of the groom].<br>When a person divorces a wife [whose <i>ketubah</i> has been underwritten in the above fashion], he must first take a vow<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">16</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Moreover, this vow must be taken <i>al da'at rabbim</i>, based on the judgement of the public, and it thus cannot be nullified (<i>Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer</i> 102:7).</i> that she is forbidden to derive benefit from him.

The woman should take the oath when she comes to collect the money due her by virtue of her <i>ketubah</i>, and not when she comes asking for support. The <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Even HaEzer</i> 93:19) appears to favor this view, and the Ramah states that it should be followed.</i> This ruling should not be followed; they have misunderstood [the situation, erroneously associating it with that of] a woman whose husband left on an overseas journey.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">35</sup><i class=\"footnote\">See Chapter 12, Halachah 16.</i><br>My teachers<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">36</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rav Yosef Migash.</i> ruled that she should not be allotted support until she takes an oath in court.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">37</sup><i class=\"footnote\">They interpret <i>Ketubot</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>) to be referring to a woman whose husband traveled overseas. She should not take an oath at the outset - i.e., when she comes to collect her subsistence - but rather at the end, if her husband comes and requires this of her. See Chapter 12, Halachah 21.<br>The dissenting authorities refute this interpretation, explaining that it is far more reasonable to require an oath of a woman when her husband is alive than after his death, for after his death it is very likely that the woman will soon take an oath to collect her <i>ketubah</i>.</i> For she is coming to collect from property in the possession of heirs, and anyone who collects property in the possession of heirs may do so only after an oath has been taken. My own conception [also] follows [this approach], and it is proper to rule accordingly."

The provision on which the present was based was never fulfilled.<br>Seemingly, this property can be compared to a woman's property of which her husband was unaware. As mentioned in the notes on the previous halachah, the husband has the right to inherit such property, and thus he should also inherit the property mentioned in this clause.<br>Rabbenu Nissim explains that since the Rambam maintains that a husband's right to inherit his wife's property is a Rabbinical ordinance, there is room for leniency when, as in the present case, it is obvious that the woman did not desire her husband to inherit her estate. Obviously motivated by the same question, but unwilling to offer such a resolution, Rav David Arameah explains that the Rambam's ruling applies in an instance when the woman in fact expressed her consent to the present before her death.</i>"

The Rambam, however, does not accept this rationale. Since this obligation is due only after the husband's death or divorce, there is nothing pressuring her husband to pay it. If he demands that his wife waive this obligation, she may refuse, asking him: \"Is it because you want to divorce me that you are asking me to waive this obligation?\" (<i>Maggid Mishneh</i>).</i> For the husband is not bringing a proof for the sake of taking possession or maintaining possession of property, merely to free himself of the obligation to pay a claim [his wife will issue].<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">50</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad objects to the Rambam's ruling.

Hence, the marriage is not binding at all and no divorce is necessary.
