            "english": "All of the lands that [the Jews] who ascended from Egypt took possession of were sanctified in the first consecration [of the land]. When they were exiled, that sanctity was nullified.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">22</sup><i class=\"footnote\">In <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah</i> 6:16, the Rambam states: \"It was no longer <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>,\" i.e., none of the halachic obligations apply there.</i> [The rationale is that] the initial consecration came about because of the conquest. [Hence,] its consecration was effective for the time [it was under their rule], but not for all time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">23</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since it was established by conquest, it could be nullified by conquest. See <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i> The Radbaz explains that when the Jews ascended from Egypt, they did not make a statement, consecrating the land. Therefore its holiness could be nullified.</i> When, by contrast, the descendants of the exiles ascended [from Babylon] and took possession of a portion of the land,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">24</sup><i class=\"footnote\">As <i>Yevamot</i> 16a states: \"Much of the land that was conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt was not conquered by [the Jews who] ascended from Babylon.</i> they consecrated it a second time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">25</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Nevertheless, since the entire Jewish people did not return together with Ezra, this consecration is only of Rabbinic origin.</i> [This consecration] is perpetuated forever, for that time and for all time.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus at present, Ezra's consecration of the land is still effective.<br>In his gloss to <i>Hilchot Beit HaBechirah, loc. cit.</i>, the <i>Kessef Mishnah</i> finds these statements difficult to accept because of the following questions:<br>a) On what basis is <i>chazakah</i> considered a more effective means of acquisition than conquest?<br>b) After the initial conquest of Eretz Yisrael, the Jewish people manifested their ownership over it and thus, effected a <i>chazakah</i>. If so, why is Ezra's <i>chazakah</i>, which was not preceded by conquest, more effective than the <i>chazakah</i> which followed the original conquest? Why should the conquest detract from the consecration of the land?<br>To explain: As mentioned above, the Jewish people's ownership of the land began with God's promise of the land to Abraham. The sanctity of the land, by contrast, did not begin until the Jewish people actually took possession of it, upon their reentry into the land after the exodus from Egypt and the journey through the desert. At that time, they were commanded to conquer the land and take it forcefully from the Gentiles (see Numbers 32:29,Deuteronomy 3:21, <i>et al</i>). Since God made the consecration of the land dependent upon its conquest by the Jewish people, it follows that conquest by a Gentile nation can nullify its holiness.<br>In contrast, Ezra was not commanded to reconquer <i>Eretz Yisrael,</i> but to settle it. In this instance, God made the sanctity of the land dependent on the Jewish people manifesting their ownership over it. In other words, the sanctity came from manifesting the true reality: that <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> is a Jewish land. Accordingly, since <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> remains our land, regardless of how many times it has been conquered by Gentiles, the sanctity effected by that manifestation of ownership also continues eternally (<i>Likkutei Sichot</i>, Vol. XV, pp. 102-109).</i><br>[The Sages] left those places that had been settled by [the Jews who] ascended from Egypt, but were not settled by those who ascended from Babylon in their previous [halachic status] and did not exempt them from [the obligations of] <i>terumah</i> and tithes so that the poor could rely upon them in the Sabbatical year.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">27</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And receive the tithe of the poor.</i> Our holy teacher<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">28</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i>.</i> released Beit Shan<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">29</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad differs with the Rambam and maintains that Beit Shan was released only from those obligations that are of Rabbinic origin.</i> from those places which [the Jews] who ascended from Babylon did not take hold of. He decided that Ashkelon should be exempted from the tithes.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">30</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> relates that Rabbi Yehudah <i>HaNasi</i> released these cities from the obligation of the tithes, because they were not populated by Jews and were not close to the area settled by Jews.</i>"

The Radbaz does not accept this perspective, stating that there is no source which maintains that a Rabbinic obligation exists.

If this work is completed in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the obligation to separate the tithes has already been incurred and they must be separated even if the produce was later taken to the Diaspora. For this reason, in most instances, <i>terumah</i> and tithes must be separated from produce that is grown in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i> in the present age and later exported to the Diaspora.

The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> answers that since the prooftext mentions \"the bread of the land,\" one can conclude that the obligation applies only to produce grown in the Holy Land itself. Alternatively, the <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> suggests that indeed if the work that makes the produce obligated to be tithed is completed only in <i>Eretz Yisrael</i>, the obligation is indeed Scriptural in origin.

This interpretation enables us to understand an otherwise difficult passage in the <i>Tosefta, Terumot</i> 3:9.</i> and 50 <i>se'ah</i> in another,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">58</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Everything that is in the same room is considered as being in the same location even if the two piles of produce are not touching each other (Radbaz; see the following halachah).</i> he should not separate two <i>se'ah</i> from one room for the entire 100 <i>se'ah</i>, for he would be separating produce from one location for produce from another.<br>[After the fact,] if one separated <i>terumah</i> from one location for produce in another, the separation is effective,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">59</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The <i>Siftei Cohen</i> 331:49 explains the rationale for the above restriction and why it is not binding after the fact. As mentioned above, according to Rabbinic Law, one must separate between one fortieth and one sixtieth of the crop as <i>terumah</i> and that separation must be made by estimation. Hence, in order to make an appropriate estimation, one must be in the same place as the produce. Nevertheless, since according to Scriptural Law, one fulfills his obligation with even one grain, after the fact, such a separation is not disqualified.</i> \n provided the produce separated [as <i>terumah</i>] is protected. If, however, a person possessed jugs of oil and/or wine and saw that they were breaking, should he say: \"These are <i>terumah</i> for the produce in my home,\"<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">60</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And thus try to receive something of value for the wine and/or oil that will be spilled.</i> his words are of no consequence.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">61</sup><i class=\"footnote\">Since the jugs are breaking, we considered them as having been broken already and the produce as having been spilled. When quoting this law, the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> (<i>Yoreh De'ah</i> 331:25) states that in the present age, when <i>terumah</i> is destroyed regardless because of its impurity, even when the jugs are breaking, the separation is effective.</i>"

Since the cake of figs is made from several discrete elements, it is not considered as a single entity with regard to the laws of ritual impurity. Hence, the fact that one portion has been touched by a source of ritual impurity does not cause another portion to become impure.

[This is derived from Numbers 18:29:] \"its sacred portion from it.\" [Implied is that] one should take from the sacred portion in it.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">26</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The verse indicates that when one is separating <i>terumat ma'aser</i>, it is possible that there be a \"sacred.\" i.e., pure, portion, and a portion that is not \"sacred,\" i.e., impure, and the pure should be separated for the impure.

The Rambam notes this difficulty when discussing this mitzvah in <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> and states that since our Sages mentioned that this mitzvah was of Scriptural origin, he considered it as having that status.</i> If such a person partakes [of <i>terumah</i>], he is liable for lashes according to Scriptural Law.<br>A person who extends his foreskin<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., one was originally circumcised, but underwent an operation so that it would appear that he was not circumcised.

Instead, the intent is that he is advised to undergo the operation and not to partake of <i>terumah</i> until he does so. The <i>Sefer HaMitzvot</i> and the <i>Sefer HaChinuch</i> (<i>loc. cit.</i>), however, say that such an individual is prohibited by the Rabbis from partaking of <i>terumah</i>.</i>"

Hence, relations in which he engage are significant to a certain extent.

The Radbaz explains that this is the fundamental new concept taught by this halachah. Otherwise, it would be obvious that since relations with this child are significant and they are forbidden to this woman, they disqualify her from partaking of <i>terumah</i>.</i><br>When a daughter of an Israelite marries a priest who is nine years old, even though the relations in which he engages are significant, she is not entitled to partake of <i>terumah</i> because of [this] child, because he cannot acquire her [as his wife] until he reaches majority.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">38</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For a male cannot acquire a wife until he reaches majority.

Attaining the age of maturity is itself not sufficient (<i>Hilchot Ishut</i> 2:10-11).<br>Seemingly, this clause is also speaking about an instance where the daughter of a priest is marrying a youth who disqualifies her and the question is whether he is of sufficient physical maturity for the marriage to be significant. In that instance, however, it would be proper to speak of consecration, not marriage. For this reason, Rav Yosef Korcus defines this clause as referring to a daughter of an Israelite who is marrying a priest and the question is whether the marriage entitles her to partake of <i>terumah</i> or not.</i>"

Robbery, by contrast, involves taking something by force against the will of its owner (<i>Hilchos Geneivah</i> 1:3).</i> he must make restitution for the principal and add one fifth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">105</sup><i class=\"footnote\">And only one fifth, in contrast to the law regarding a thief in Halachah 23, where he is required to atone for the theft as well.</i> [The rationale is that] the fifth that he is liable for [to atone for partaking of] <i>terumah</i> fulfills his obligation for robbery,<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">106</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, asking why the person is not liable for an additional fifth to atone for taking a false oath concerning the robbery, as required by <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 7:1-2. The commentaries explain that according to the Rambam, it is sufficient to give one fifth, for that atones for both transgressions. Although in Halachah 24, the Rambam requires two different fifths to be given, that is because one is required to atone for partaking of consecrated property. That is a different type of transgression and that requirement is not paralleled with regard to the transgression against taking a false oath.</i> as [implied by Leviticus 22:14:] \"And you shall give the priest the sacred [food].\" He is liable only for the fifth [associated with atonement for] the sacred [food]. If he obtains <i>terumah</i> through robbery and feeds it to another person, that person must make restitution for the principal and add a fifth.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">107</sup><i class=\"footnote\">For he must atone for partaking of <i>terumah</i> unknowingly, as in Halachah 10.</i><br>Whenever we have said that a person must make restitution for the principal and add a fifth, [the intent is that] if he ate grain worth four [<i>zuz</i>], he must pay five<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">108</sup><i class=\"footnote\">I.e., the fifth is one fifth of the new total. See parallels in <i>Hilchot Arachin</i> 4:5; <i>Hilchot Meialah</i> 1:5, <i>Hilchot Gezeilah</i> 7:5, <i>et al</i>.</i> from the type of grain from which he partook. Whenever we mentioned [payment of] the principal and two fifths, [the intent is that] if he ate grain worth four [<i>zuz</i>], he must pay six. Whenever we mentioned [payment of] two principals and one fifth, [the intent is that] if he ate grain worth four [<i>zuz</i>], he must pay nine.<br>Whenever he makes restitution, he must pay for the worth of the grain at the time he partook of it whether its value depreciated at the time he made restitution or appreciated.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">109</sup><i class=\"footnote\">The Ra'avad questions the Rambam's ruling, asking why is the person not required to pay the worth at the time of the robbery if the grain depreciated in price. The Radbaz explains that this is, in fact, the Rambam's intent and this halachah is speaking about an instance when he ate the <i>terumah</i> directly after stealing it. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> states that this halachah is not necessarily speaking about a thief, but about any person who partakes of <i>terumah</i> unknowingly. The time when he partakes of the <i>terumah</i> is equivalent to the time of theft.</i>"

With regard to wine, what the person is doing is saving the ordinary wine, not the <i>terumah</i>, because there is no use for impure wine. Hence, he is permitted to do so only if he does not impart ritual impurity of Scriptural origin to the <i>terumah</i>. With regard to the oil, he is saving the oil that is <i>terumah</i> - for impure oil can be used as fuel.

In that instance, it is not sufficient to wash out the utensil, one must perform <i>hagalah</i>, boiling water in the utensil to purge the absorbed matter. The Radbaz explains that the Rambam maintains that this concept applies with regard to sanctified foods and other prohibitions, but not with regard to <i>terumah</i>. The rationale is that if the priests consider the <i>terumah</i> insignificant - as would be the case with regard to <i>terumah</i> absorbed in a pot - it is no longer of consequence. He draws support for this explanation from the mishnah in <i>Terumot</i> 11:8 (quoted in Chapter 11, Halachah 15) which states that after one pours out the contents of a jug of wine of <i>terumah</i>, one can pour ordinary wine into the container even if there is a small amount of residue from the previous wine. This explanation is also given in one of the responsa ascribed to the Rambam in a response to a question concerning this subject by the sages of Lunil. The <i>Kessef Mishneh</i> also cites these ideas and states that the reason the Rambam requires that the pot be washed out is because the contents are being cooked. If they were not to be cooked, even washing would not be necessary.</i> If he cooked [<i>terumah</i>] in part of the pot, it is not necessary to wash out the entire pot, only the place where it was cooked.<sup class=\"footnote-marker\">42</sup><i class=\"footnote\">This leniency applies only with regard to <i>terumah</i> and not to prohibited food absorbed in a utensil.
