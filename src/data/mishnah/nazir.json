This mishna discusses what must be done if <b>one of them dies</b> before bringing his offerings. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said:</b> The surviving nazirite <b>asks someone in the marketplace,</b> a non-nazirite, <b>to vow to be a nazirite corresponding to him,</b> i.e., under the same conditions as his own naziriteship, so that he can bring offerings together with him. <b>And he says</b> to him as follows: <b>If I was impure, you are hereby a nazirite immediately; and if I was pure, you are hereby a nazirite after thirty days.

And if I</b> was <b>the pure</b> one, and the deceased nazirite was impure, <b>the offering of purity</b> we brought thirty days ago was <b>mine, and the offering of impurity</b> we brought earlier was <b>of uncertain</b> status, <b>and this is your offering of purity.</b> <b>Ben Zoma said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>And who will listen to him to vow to be a nazirite corresponding to him?</b> How can one design a <i>halakha</i> on the assumption that a non-nazirite will agree to be a nazirite for a lengthy term? <b>Rather,</b> a different procedure is available: After thirty days of naziriteship <b>he brings a bird sin-offering and an animal burnt-offering, and says: If I was impure, the sin-offering is for my obligation</b> as an impure nazirite, <b>and the burnt-offering</b> is a regular <b>gift</b> offering. <b>And if I was pure, the burnt-offering is for my obligation</b> as a pure nazirite, <b>and the sin-offering</b> is <b>of uncertain</b> status. <b>And he counts</b> another <b>thirty days, and brings an offering of purity, and says: If I was impure, the first burnt-offering</b> I brought should be considered <b>a gift</b> offering, <b>and this</b> one I am bringing now is for my <b>obligation. And if I was pure, the first burnt-offering</b> I brought is for my <b>obligation</b> as a pure nazirite, <b>and this</b> one I am bringing now is <b>a gift</b> offering. <b>And these,</b> i.e., the sin-offering and peace-offering I am sacrificing now, comprises <b>the rest of my offerings</b> that I was obligated to bring earlier. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said:</b> According to your opinion, <b>it turns out</b> that <b>this</b> nazirite <b>brings his offerings in halves,</b> i.e., in stages. If he was pure, he brings his burnt-offering thirty days before the rest of his offerings. <b>However, the Rabbis agreed with ben Zoma,</b> and disregarded the concern about splitting up the offerings."

The problem facing this nazirite is that a leper must shave both when he begins his purification process and at the close of it, one week later. However, a nazirite is prohibited from shaving. Additionally, a leper may not partake of sacrificial food, but a nazirite may. Therefore, <b>he may partake of sacrificial food sixty days after</b> he may have become impure, when the uncertainty with regard to leprosy will have been clarified. He shaves for the first time for his leprosy after thirty days, and for the second time thirty days later, the shaving of the end of the purification process; at which point he brings the offerings of a purified leper and may partake of sacrificial food. <b>But</b> he <b>may drink wine and become impure from the dead,</b> effectively ending his naziriteship, only <b>after 120 days.</b> This is because he might have been a full-fledged leper, which means that his shavings count toward his leprosy, not his naziriteship. Consequently, after the first sixty days he must observe another thirty days of naziriteship and shave again. Even then he has yet to fulfill all his obligations, as he might have been impure from a corpse, which means his shaving after ninety days was for his impurity. He must therefore remain a nazirite for another thirty days, before shaving one final time at the end of 120 days to fulfill his naziriteship obligation. The mishna notes: The reason that he cannot shave for his leprosy after seven days and perform the second shaving of a leper seven days later is <b>because the shaving of leprosy overrides</b> the prohibition of <b>the shaving of a nazirite</b> only <b>when his</b> status as <b>a leper</b> is <b>definite. However, when his</b> status as <b>a leper</b> is <b>uncertain,</b> the shaving <b>does not override</b> his naziriteship, and therefore he must wait thirty days before each of his shavings for leprosy."

They are not subject to the prohibitions of a nazirite, nor does one accept their offerings at the end of naziriteship. However, <b>women and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves do have naziriteship.</b> The mishna adds: There is a greater <b>stringency in</b> the case of <b>women than in</b> the case of <b>slaves, as</b> a master <b>may force his slave</b> to drink wine, shave his hair, or become ritually impure from a corpse, despite the slave’s vow of naziriteship, <b>but</b> a husband <b>cannot force his wife</b> to transgress her naziriteship. The previous mishna taught that the naziriteship of women includes a stringency that does not apply to slaves. This mishna adds: There is a greater <b>stringency in</b> the case of <b>slaves than in</b> the case of <b>women, as</b> a man <b>can nullify the vows of his wife but he cannot nullify the vows of his slave,</b> despite the fact that he can prevent him from fulfilling them in practice. Similarly, if <b>he nullified</b> the naziriteship <b>of his wife it is permanently nullified,</b> and it remains nullified even if she is later divorced or widowed. Conversely, if <b>he nullified</b> the naziriteship <b>of his slave</b> by forcing him to violate the terms of his vow of naziriteship, when the slave <b>is emancipated he completes his naziriteship.</b> In a case where a slave took a vow of naziriteship but was prevented by his master from fulfilling the terms of his vow, the Sages engaged in a dispute what the <i>halakha</i> would be if he permanently <b>left his</b> master’s <b>presence,</b> i.e., he ran away without being emancipated. <b>Rabbi Meir says: He may not drink</b> wine. Since the slave is free in practice, his vow goes into effect. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: He may drink</b> wine, as he is not emancipated."

This verse indicates <b>that there was fear of flesh and blood upon</b> Samuel. Consequently, the term <i>mora</i> must be understood in accordance with its plain meaning of a razor.
